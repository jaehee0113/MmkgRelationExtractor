Protests are scheduled to be held in more than 12 cities across the country and the world following the lynching of a 15-year-old Muslim boy.

The violence in India is eerily similar to what we have been seeing in Pakistan where Ahmadis, Shias and others are routinely targeted for their faith. Right-wingers in India are using the country’s ‘beef ban’ like their counterparts in Pakistan are (mis)using ‘blasphemy’. Images of the bloodied 15-year old Junaid Khan dying in his brother’s arms evoke memories of the murder of Mashal Khan, the student lynched in Mardan in April.

To quote former book publisher Amit Shah from Kolkata: “Militant Hinduism is not a religion; it is fascism in saffron. We (Indians both in India and Indian-born like myself) have never seen such hatred toward Muslims by Hindus in our lifetime. We are post-partition, Independent India children”.

He is right, and we Pakistanis are the same people.

I tweeted: “Militant Hinduism is not a religion; it is fascism in saffron” Ditto militant Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism Militancy = fascism”. So, in solidarity with my comrades in India, I too am participating in the “Not In My Name” campaign.

"Militant Hinduism is not a religion; it is fascism in saffron"

Ditto militant Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism

Militancy = fascism — beena sarwar (@beenasarwar) June 27, 2017

After the murder of Mashal I wrote a piece titled ‘Pakistan’s road to redemption‘ arguing that how we respond to such injustices is what will define us going forward. I also wrote that the strength of the pushback against fascism in the USA, in India and Pakistan appears to be roughly proportionate to the strength of their functioning democracies and how long they have had a continual democratic political process. A continuation of this process will eventually reap dividends, but along the way there will be painful losses and more bloodshed.

Americans began “Not in My Name” protests in the 1970s against the invasion of Vietnam. The slogan has since been used to counter many other militant actions.

Filmmaker Anand Patwardhan has called for supporters to wear black armbands or black ribbons for at least a week.

Those who want participate in this campaign by adding #NotInMyName to their profile picture can do so using this app.

Rajdeep Sardesai’s words in his excellent piece The poison of ‘kuch log’ ring true for Pakistan and elsewhere too. “Fall in line or face retribution. You don’t need a riot any more when one lynching will settle the argument, where a union minister will attend the funeral of the killers in Dadri but not provide solace to a grieving family, where the killers are ‘honoured’ in Alwar but victims are left to fight their own battle for justice”.

As I wrote after witnessing racist abuse here in Boston, being a bystander is not an option. We’re seeing Muslims, ‘Muslim-looking’ and ‘other’ people being attacked in the US too, where signals from the top are not sympathetic to Muslims, despite lip service. For the first time in nearly 20 years the White House didn’t host its annual Iftar dinner. In India, for the first time, no ministers from India’s ruling party attended the president’s annual Iftar. It was also the first time that the UP Congress cancelled its annual Iftar.

Sardesai’s words further on – “Because India is not Pakistan and cannot and must not be a majoritarian state” – may serve to instill a sense of shame in closet nationalists/ fence-sitters and push them to speak out to prove they are not like Pakistan (a dirty word in India). However, these words also, I’m sure unintentionally, play down the struggle of democratic minded Pakistanis and pander to the us vs. them mentality.

The forces of fascism are the same, no matter what ‘ism’ they claim to follow. Indian activist Harsh Mander has called for a world of new solidarity, stressing the need for cross-border as well as cross-community solidarity. His words resonate universally.

Ending Factory Farming

Factory farms, also known as CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) or IFAP (Industrial Farm Animal Production) facilities can house more than 125,000 animals under one roof and are designed to produce the highest possible output at the lowest possible cost to the operator. These farms and their associated industrial slaughterhouses produce “cheap” meat, eggs, and dairy by externalizing their costs. The costs to the public from the ecological damage and health problems created by factory farms are not considered any more than the law requires, and companies have often found it less expensive to pay fines than to alter their methods. For this reason, the true cost of meat is never reflected in the price consumers pay. Animal suffering is given no meaningful consideration except in a few idiosyncratic cases.

Factory farming now accounts for more than 99 percent of all farmed animals raised and slaughtered in the United States. (Virtually all seafood comes to us by way of industrial fishing or factory fish farms.)

Farmed animals are remarkable creatures who experience pleasure (pasture-raised pigs, for instance, are known to jump for joy) and have complex social structures (cows develop friendships over time and will sometimes hold grudges against other animals who treat them badly). The cheap animal products churned out by factory farms come at a high cost to the animals themselves (many are confined so intensively that they cannot turn around or stretch a wing). The structure of factory farming ensures that even the animals’ most fundamental needs—clean air, sunshine, freedom from chronic pain and illness—are denied them.

The present system of producing food animals in the United States is not sustainable and presents an unacceptable level of risk to public health and damage to the environment, as well as unnecessary harm to the animals we raise for food.”

–Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production

At the same time, factory farming’s industrial slaughterhouses have created worker conditions that Human Rights Watch describes as “systematic human rights abuses.” Employing illegal immigrants and underage workers is a common practice—in part because the vulnerability of these populations allows the industry to avoid compensating them for the numerous injuries and chronic pain that are equally standard in industrial slaughter. Processing-plant line workers in California interviewed by Farm Forward reported, to their shame, that it was not uncommon for them to be denied access to the bathroom in order to “hold the line” and maintain productivity.

The factory farm record on the environment is no better: World Watch, the Sierra Club, the Pew Commission, Greenpeace, and other major environmental watchdogs have singled out factory farms as among the biggest polluters on the planet. There is now a scientific consensus that animal agriculture is the single largest contributor to global warming—outstripping even the transportation industry in its production of greenhouse gases. A 2008 New York Times article reported that “if Americans were to reduce meat consumption by just 20 percent it would be as if we all switched from a standard sedan—a Camry, say—to the ultra-efficient Prius.”

The disturbing nature of these problems can make it difficult for many people to accept the truth about factory farming when they are first confronted with it: “Surely,” one is tempted to say, “it can’t be that bad.” But once the scale of the devastation that this industry is wreaking on our health, the environment, and animals becomes clear, the most surprising aspect of factory farming is how effectively these problems have been hidden from the public in the first place.

There are more humane, more just, and more sustainable ways to eat, and, more than ever before, there are numerous, progressive alternatives to factory farms. With your help, we can find a better way forward.

So what’s the solution?

Educate Eat Farm
NDTV​ ​Consulting Editor Barkha Dutt engages Sadhguru in a conversation during the Penguin Random House “Spring Fever Festival” in Delhi. Sadhguru looks at why Indian culture always recommended that a human being avoid eating beef. He explains how it isn’t about morality, but about what is most appropriate for the body.

Full Transcript:

Barkha Dutt: We live in times when faith and spirituality have become very inflammable…

Sadhguru: Don’t put them in the same basket.

Barkha Dutt: Okay, let’s talk about faith first.

Sadhguru: Mhmm (Indicating agreement).

Barkha Dutt: We live in times when faith for certain has become a very inflammable, easily politicized conversation. If faith should have been personal today, it’s not. Today you actually have decisions taken in the name of somebody’s faith being injured. So you mentioned food right now, I read somewhere that you said there’s nothing religious about the act of food, just eat what you like.

Sadhguru: No, no, no, I didn’t say that.

Barkha Dutt: Eat what’s good for you?

Sadhguru: I said eat what’s good for you.

Barkha Dutt: Okay, eat what’s good for you.

Sadhguru: It’s a very different thing (Laughs).

Barkha Dutt: I correct myself (Sadhguru laughs) – eat what’s good for you. But today we have a highly politicized conversation around banning beef in the name of faith. How…

Sadhguru: It’s definitely not good for you to eat it.

Barkha Dutt: Beef or any meat?

Sadhguru: I’ll come to that. Finish it, finish the question.

Barkha Dutt: Okay, okay. So I’m offering that as one example of how I see a politicized conversation taking place around faith. How do you reconcile the faith of a large number of people with questions of individual liberty? I know I have read that you like books written by Salman Rushdie. We were the first country to ban him again in the name of faith. How do we reconcile faith with individual liberty?

Time 80:06

Sadhguru: See, it’s always been said “faith moves mountains.” Yes, but it freezes your mind. But the greatest crime you can do on this planet is to move a mountain. You should not move a mountain, it should be where it is, it has not just dropped from somewhere, it’s grown because of various forces functioning in a particular way, phenomenal activity has happened to build a mountain. You should never move a mountain but (Laughs) people with frozen minds always want to move a mountain, okay? Having said that, this needs to be understood – that when we say faith, it’s an import for this culture. We have never had faith in this culture. You must look back little beyond thousand years since we’ve been under occupation. Here, we have been told always, “Your life is your karma.” Karma means action. Whose action? Your action.

So what we are saying is your life is entirely your making. There is no someone sitting up there and managing this for you. This is entirely yours but for every action that you perform -whether physical, mental, emotional, energy-wise – whatever kind of action you perform, there is bound to be a consequence. If you’re ready for the consequence, do whatever. If you’re going to cry about the consequence, control the action right now. Based on this… Now you came to food, see the food consumption has been looked at very carefully in this country. If you just bring this back, the world will be healthy, do you understand? Here, we have identified different type of people, what they should eat. If you’re doing menial jobs, how you should eat. If you’re doing trading, how you should eat. If you’re into spiritual process, how you should eat. If you’re into education, how you should eat. Why this is is each person needs a different type of building of the body. You want to run hundred meters next to Mr. Bolt, what kind of food you should eat. You just want to work in Delhi, what kind of food you should eat. You want to think in a certain way, what kind of food you’d… you should eat. For all these, we have very clear prescriptions.

Now when it comes to food, what it means is, we are taking another life, whatever that is – it may be plant life, animal life, whatever – you’re taking another life, ingesting it and you have to make it your life – that’s the whole thing. What is your life, what is that life, if you look at it, all life on this planet is coming from the earth. This body (Gestures) is also the same soil, this (Gestures) is also same soil, if there is a (an?) earthworm, that is also same soil but see how it has become, how this (Gestures) has become, how that (Gestures) has become. If I give you… You like a mango or a banana?

Barkha Dutt: Mango.

Time 83:04

Sadhguru: Mango. I know, (Laughs) you’re ru… you’re ruling the state right now (Referring to the Aam Aadmi party (translates as The Common Man party), currently in power in Delhi, the word “aam” means common and also mango) (Laughter). Now, if you eat a ma… mango, this mango becomes a woman in you. If I eat a mango, the same mango becomes a man in me. If a cow eats a mango, the same mango becomes a cow in the cow. Why is this happening? There is a certain information or software in you – whatever you eat it transforms it into a woman. If I eat, it transforms into a man. If a cow eats, that becomes a cow. So every life is happening the way it is happening because of a certain dimension of information or in modern terminology, let’s call it software. There is a certain software, which is an arrangement of information.

Now, the idea is to eat as simple a software as possible. If you eat that kind of life, which is a very simple software, your ability to override that software and make it entirely a part of you is very good. As that software gets comp… complex, more and more complex, your ability to integrate it goes down. So, especially if it’s a creature which has some sense of thought and emotion, if it has emotion, then you should not eat it. This is the understanding. An animal, which has any emotion, displays certain emotions… especially if it displays emotion which is near to human emotion, you should not eat it because it will not integrate itself. That animal nature will start manifesting itself.

Or in other words, in India, today maybe in cities people do not know, you see in the villages, people have very intimate relationship with a cow. They have drunk the milk of that cow, their children are drinking the milk of that cow, there is a very deep relationship. If you do not know this, cow is one creature, if something happens to you and you are in some kind of grief or misery, you don’t have to be near the cow, wherever the cow is in your house, it will str… it’ll start shedding tears for you. You know, I’ve seen this with my eyes, I couldn’t believe – when somebody is dead in the house it… what does a cow know, it is somewhere, simply tears flowing. So when it’s… has such deep emotions, if you kill it, it’s like killing a human being, it’s murder or it’s cannibalism.

So because of that – this is not a faith thing, this is not a religious thing, we thought this is a fundamental sense. Why (Fumbles)… When we are hungry, why can’t I cut you up and eat you? What’s wrong (Laughter)? What’s wrong, I’m asking?

Time 85:42

Barkha Dutt: But what you’re saying should be about many more animals than just the cow.

Sadhguru: Yes, yes of course.

Barkha Dutt: And when it becomes about only the cow, then there is a… there is certainly a perception…

Sadhguru: I… It is not…

Barkha Dutt: …that it is a political decision or a religious decision.

Sadhguru: No, no, I am not talking about the… whatever the laws that are happ…

Barkha Dutt: This is not about people getting up and saying, “It’s cruel to be… to be a meat-eater.” That would be a different argument.

Sadhguru: Hmm, I am not even talking about cruelty. Even cutting a plant is cruel, in my experience but you have to do it. But if you are conscious of it, you will do it to the minimum possible extent, not do it wantonly, that’s the whole thing.

Now, about this political ban about cow slaughter or whatever, this has many things. One thing is there is a sensitivity, once you drink milk from the cow, she is like your mother. Killing your mother and eating her up is something people cannot digest in this country. Still eighty percent of the people belong to that category and they’re… they’re hugely… there’s a huge emotion, such a (an?) emotion, which because they’ve always been made to be docile in a certain way, they have not violently rela… reacted to it but in some places it has happened, in villages and other places. There is already a beef ban in many villages just by norm, not by any law, that you don’t bring these kind of thin… things into the village.

I am not saying you must ban it or not ban it. I am saying the sensitivities of your population, you… without considering, you can’t go do this blatantly. Because it is growing, it’s becoming a growing business; India is becoming a major exporter of beef, that’s not right. Even if somebody ate something, it is up to them, it’s their personal taste, whatever but now you’re promoting it and you’re making it grow. There is serious concern but our people don’t express it, our people don’t go out on the street and not going to kill anybody because they killed a cow.

So ban is not what is needed, more education was needed rather than banning. But definitely, eating larger creatures… Why can’t you have a dog bet (pet?) and if you’re hungry cut it up and eat it today? Or why can’t you cut up your wife and eat her today? I mean it’ll all come to that one by one. This may look like an extreme argument but I’m telling you once… human mind is such, you give it little latitude, it will go on taking advantage of it, it’ll go, go, go, go. After hundred years, they’ll be doing something that you can’t imagine that a human being can do.

Time 88:15

Barkha Dutt: But you haven’t spoken to what happens when faith… Faith repeatedly seems to come into conflict with individual liberty by the banning of books. There were people killed in Paris because they were seen to have mocked, you know of the Prophet Mohammed and so on.

Sadhguru: See…

Barkha Dutt: So where does this end? Where do we stop violence and politics in the name of religion?

Sadhguru: If you… If you want that to stop, you must understand this. You’re saying, “Today, today.” It’s not today. In the last 2,000 years, this is the history of the world, continuously it’s happening all over the world.

Barkha Dutt: So is that bombers are a new phenomenon?

Sadhguru: Well, you’ve forgotten about the Crusades and the other things, which have not been reported in history (Laughs). Hundreds of millions of people have been killed in the name of god, all right? It’s new to us here, but even here, thousands… hundreds and thousands have been slaughtered in northern part of India just because the faith that they belonged to when the invasions happened. Nobody writes about it because we never took the pen and wrote, somebody wrote history for us the way they like it. Because all history is sponsored by kings, they wrote the history the way they want and they said they are great emperors but what they did was absolutely terrible.

So you need to understand, faith is a new thing to us. When I say new, in this country which has 12-15,000 years of history behind us, 1,000 years is new for us, we’ve still not come to terms with it; we’re still struggling with it. But struggling within ourselves, not creating a struggle on the street because that’s not our nature because here always we’ve (it’s?) been drilled into us, whatever you do there’ll be a consequence for you. Even if you come back another life, another life, it won’t leave you, it’ll come back to you. Tch, this has been told… This controls people, this is a… This is a tremendous technology, please understand this, and it’s not simply a fake thing, it is a real thing. Everything that you think, feel, act, there is a consequence. Not because there is somebody thinking he must give… gift… give you a reward or a punishment. It happens in your own chemistry.

At least 17 ghastly attacks by self-styled cow protectors or mobs in the name of the cow have shocked India over the last 22 month alone. These instances of mob 'justice' are a worrying trend for India in 2017.

Chennai :

While many cities, on June 28, organised #notinmyname campaign, speaking out against the vigilante violence, Chennai, too, will do the same on July 1. Two events will be conducted in the city: one titled ‘Break the Silence,’ which will take place at Valluvar Kottam from 11 am onwards, while the #notinmyname will happen at Gandhi Statue near Marina Beach from 4 pm onwards.





Prema Revathi, one of the members of the collective who has organised the ‘Break the Silence’ gathering, said that many people decided to come together and create a forum, where the public can break the silence around the increasing occurrences of mob violence against people suspected of possessing beef or for being different.





“The reason we decided to choose ‘Break the Silence’ because we are all a part of this. These deaths are happening in front of everyone, including us. We feel that it is time we raised our voices. In addition, the government is silent on these incidents. They are expected to act by the rule of law. But no action is taken, enabling the mob mentality,” she said.





The #notinmyname organisers wrote on the official page, “A lynching is the ultimate act of cowardice carried out with full strength. It is what makes cold blooded murder look like an honorable thing to do. Our only strength is numbers. Right now, we are hilariously, hopelessly outnumbered.”





For poet Kavitha Muralidharan, there was an urgent need for a strong public response. “The time we are living in is dangerous. Nobody is speaking about the incident. The civil society hasn’t raised its voice. The silence is disturbing, which is why such instances keep recurring. This mob violence has become a new normal and there is something terribly wrong about that,” she said.





Environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman said the lack of outcry from the civil society will only embolden the self-appointed cow vigilantes. “With each passing incident left unchallenged, the vigilantes gain ground. That will move us towards an uncomfortable, authoritarian, majoritarian rule, which will negate the diversity that India is,” he concluded.




India’s environment ministry under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government called for a nationwide ban on the sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter late last month. This elicited fresh controversy around an ongoing issue labeled the “beef ban” in India.

Over the last two weeks, several administrators in states for whom beef is an integral part of local cuisine have aggressively opposed the order. Kerala Youth Congress leaders slaughtered a calf publicly, and “beef festivals” were held in South Indian colleges to protest the ban, fueling outrage from the BJP and Hindu hardliners nationwide.

Hindu versus Muslim?

Cows are considered sacred in Hinduism, India’s majority religion. Thus the trade and consumption of beef has become a very contentious issue ever since the BJP came into power in 2014. Despite India’s official status as a “secular” country, it is worth bearing in mind that the ruling party operates ideologically under the aegis of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu fundamentalist body, that has repeatedly pushed to prohibit the slaughter of cattle across the country.

Around 18 Indian states, (including Gujarat, home to a large, vegetarian Hindu population, and where Modi was formerly Chief Minister), have already banned the slaughter of cattle.

In April, the government even told the Supreme Court that all cows will be provided unique identification numbers, with a tamper-proof plastic tag linked to a national database, in an effort to prevent cattle "smuggling" within India and beyond its borders.

But millions of Indians, including Dalits (formerly “untouchables” in the Hindu caste system), Muslims and Christians, have long consumed beef. It is one of the cheapest meats available, making it an attractive source of protein for India’s poor.

Still, the "beef ban" is often pitted as a Hindu-versus-Muslim issue, because Muslims dominate the multi-billion dollar meat business in India, which stands to take a huge hit should a nationwide ban on beef be fully implemented.

Animal welfare at the cost of GDP and citizens' rights?

Reports indicate that India exports beef worth $4 billion annually, and that the ban is already causing concern over a potential rise in global beef prices due to reduced supply, given that the country is currently among the world’s biggest exporters of the meat by volume.

But arguably even more worrisome is the impact on the social and religious equilibrium of India’s hugely diverse and complex society. Beef traders and consumers have been frequently attacked and even killed by Hindu vigilante cow protection groups over the last two years.

Falling back on the complicated phrasing of the notice, the government has claimed that the order is aimed at preventing unregulated animal trade, not policing people’s food choices per se. But regardless of the technicalities and the fine print, the fact is that it has fueled communalist sentiments, and if implemented nationwide, will result in a loss of millions of jobs.

Patriotic or unconstitutional?

Contrary to the perception of India in the western imagination as a predominantly vegetarian country, according to recent National Sample Survey data, more than 70% of Indians above the age of 15 are non-vegetarian. And while chicken is the most widely consumed meat, even classic beef items like burgers and steaks had become popular on menus in top restaurants across Indian cities in the last decade, where patrons include wealthy urban Hindus.

While proponents claim the ban protects traditional Hindu values, not all India's Hindus are actually in favor of it. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan have vociferously opposed the ban because their states traditionally consume beef. Many Indian liberals have questioned whether such a ban is constitutional, arguing that the policing of food choices infringes on the basic rights of citizens.

Unnecessarily divisive

Historically, Indian society, and Hinduism as a religion, have been associated with tolerance, compassion, and a "live and let live" attitude. However in the prickly social climate that our current government has fostered, it's unfortunate than an issue as seemingly innocuous as dietary preference has become so dangerously polarizing.

Many who don't eat beef but were previously not concerned with others eating it, have become roused into taking a stronger, less tolerant stance than before. While those who simply ate beef to subsist, suddenly feel like they have a point to prove.

Finally, an instance in which beef between geopolitical rivals isn’t such a bad thing.

With the first shipment of U.S. beef in over a decade arriving in China on Wednesday, Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, took a look back at the winners and losers of China’s 14-year ban on American beef in the wake of the mad cow disease scare in late 2003.

That year, the U.S. was the second-largest exporter of frozen beef to mainland China after Hong Kong — whose opacity when it comes to goods coming, changing hands, and going makes it a major player in the so-called gray market — and ahead of Australia and New Zealand. After the ban went into effect, however, new bovine business partners began to emerge, including Uruguay, South Korea, Brazil, and — briefly — India.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 70 percent of beef imported to China before the ban took effect came from the U.S., suggesting the vast majority of beef imported “from Hong Kong” was in fact of American origin.

In 2015, the last year for which data is available, China received 84 percent of its imported frozen beef from Australia (30 percent), Uruguay (20 percent), Brazil (19 percent), and New Zealand (15 percent). Brazil, along with Argentina and Canada (7.2 percent each), is a relative newcomer to the group, as China also banned beef imports from these three countries from 2001 to 2009.

China’s deputy finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, named July 16 — 100 days after the meeting between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida — as a tentative date for resuming beef imports from the U.S. The two countries agreed in 2016 to allow U.S. beef back on the Chinese market, but trade did not resume until this year.

But Reuters reported that the first shipment of American beef left for China on June 14, two days after Washington finalized a deal to resume exports. Henry Davis, CEO of Greater Omaha Packing, the company behind the shipment, told Reuters that each box on the flight was labeled in both English and Chinese.

As part of the new deal with China, American beef producers will have to comply with a host of quality control standards. Cattle earmarked for beef export to China must be traceable to their birth farm (or if imported from Mexico or Canada, to their first place of residence in the U.S.), less than 30 months old, and free of chemicals and growth hormones.

So far, only Greater Omaha and Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in the U.S., have been certified by the USDA to ship beef to China, and Reuters reported that according to Cargill, another major U.S. meat producer, “only a small percentage of the total current U.S. cattle supply would qualify for exports to China under the terms of the new trade agreement.”

In a statement accompanying the U.S. government’s June 12 announcement of resumed beef exports, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said, “I have no doubt that as soon as the Chinese people get a taste of American beef, they’ll want more of it.”

A grotesque image of a man and a little girl smiling as their faces are smeared in blood is going viral on Facebook in India. The picture is accompanied with provocative text that claims the man played ‘Holi’ with the blood of a cow on ‘Bakrid’ and is making India “secular”.

The image with posted by a Facebook user Prabhas Arya has been shared over 500 times. Many others have commented expressing shock at the insensitive language and image posted by ‘Muhammad Firoz Khan’. A random check of the old posts by Prabhas Arya (Click Here) shows there is a clear pattern of anti-Muslim messages, videos, pictures and articles.

When we searched for Muhammad Firoz Khan on Facebook, we found several pages but were not able to locate any user connected to the image.

The existence of this post was brought to BOOM’s notice by one of our readers who felt that the image may have been doctored. We reverse searched the image on Google and found that the man in the image is not an Indian but a school teacher based out of Egypt.

A page dedicated to Mohamed El Askary is also available on Facebook where he has been described as a teacher/lecturer.

BOOM looked for more news articles from Egypt and using Google Translate, the following details emerged. Mohamed El Askary, a resident of Cairo had published this image with his daughter (as per some news articles) in September 2016, following the slaughter of the Eid lamb. His post attracted widespread anger and condemnation, prompting him to delete the picture, according to news reports. Askary, a history teacher and also principal of a local school in Cairo was called a ‘Vampire’ for posting this objectionable and insensitive image with a minor.

Al Arabiya quotes one of Askary’s students who defended his action and said that the teacher is known to publish strange pictures of the feast.

We also found this article by an Egyptian blogger Dina Hashish, where the author argues why young children should not witness animal sacrifices. Askary’s image with his daughter found mention in the article as the author forcefully makes her point against the practice.

BOOM has not been able to confirm whether Prabhas Arya tampered with the original image but it is clear that the image was doctored to add the provocative text. Askary’s name was changed to Muhammad Firoz Khan to give it an Indian connection, a deliberate act given the current heated debate about cow slaughter ban and the several incidents of violence against Muslims.

Manohar Parrikar is in a bind, caught between violently conflicting voices on the beef ban, even as he prepares for a critical byelection in Panaji in August. While core BJP supporters expect the chief minister to remain firm on the party's position, coalition partner Goa Forward, speaking for the state's powerful church and meat traders' lobby, is opposed to the ban.

Belligerent voices, such as that of Sadhvi Saraswati, president of the Sanatan Dharma Prachar Seva Samiti, are fuelling this fire. Speaking at the All India Hindu Conclave, held from June 14 to 18 at Ramnathi Temple in Goa, Saraswati demanded the government publicly hang those who eat beef. This prompted an instant response from Goa Forward's Vijai Sardesai, who is also the state's town planning minister. "People like Sadhvi Saraswati should come to Goa only as tourists," he said, going on to say that Saraswati had no understanding of Goans' eating habits. Struggling to strike a balance between opponents and supporters of the beef ban, Parrikar was forced to remain silent when Sardesai stated that the government would consider banning the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) for creating communal disharmony, after senior VHP members allegedly said they would 'force' the beef ban on Goans.

Parrikar seems unable to take a clear position. While on the one hand he points fingers at the Congress government in neighbouring Karnataka for stopping cattle trucks headed for Goa, on the other he blames the trouble on "people's ignorance" and deliberate attempts to "create confusion". By the look of things, it's not going to be an easy bypoll for him.
Issues like lynching and beef ban would not be discussed with BJP national president Amit Shah when he visits Goa on July 1-2, state BJP president Vinay Tendulkar said on Wednesday.





Addressing a press conference in Panaji, Tendulkar also said there was no anxiety in the state, where minorities comprise more than 30 per cent of the population, over the issue of lynching of members from the minority community and the beef ban





"Amit Shahji is coming to work for the organisation in Goa. The issues which you have raised, there is no problem as such in Goa. We will face 2019 elections by bringing together all people, from all religions and castes in Goa," Tendulkar said.





Asked if he was aware of any anxiety in a section of Goa's minority community over the beef ban and public lynching, Tendulkar said: "There is no anxiety."





Shah is to interact with elected representatives from the BJP, key party office bearers, cadre as well as professionals and businessmen from the state over the two-day period.

Junaid Khan, Mohammad Akhlaq, Pehlu Khan, Zahid Rasool Bhat, Abu Hanifa, Riazuddin Ali, Zafar Hussain, Ayub Pandit. the list can go on, will tragically go on, in a republic whose only near certain headline these days is a lynching. The protests will come, hesitant and muted. But even the tag line of the protest, “Not In My Name”, will, unconsciously, betray a sense of numb helplessness. All we can do is distance ourselves, deny our culpability. But whether we can prevent this atrocity from being repeated is another matter. A monstrous new moral order is unfolding, irrigated by the blood of our citizens. But this monstrosity is also wickedly clever. It is unfolding slowly, picking on individual victims, manifesting through a thousand cuts, rather than through a big cataclysm.

A big riot would concentrate the mind, make a damning headline. A protracted riot in slow motion, individual victims across different states, simply makes this appear another daily routine. This makes opposing it harder; it makes holding onto the outrage nearly impossible. We can keep repeating our outrage till our words are exhausted; each expression of outrage loses its power simply by being made to be repeated over and over. What began as a loud voice over Akhlaq is now a fading echo over Junaid. It is evil telling language: “I am more inexhaustible than you.” Every repetition of condemnation seems to diminish its power. After Dadri, the critics are made to sound like broken records, each protest less effective than another. Meanwhile, every act of violence emboldens another.

But if evil is already patiently wearing down protest, there is a deeper reason why this kind of violence represents a new benchmark in Indian politics. There are, of course, the usual defence mechanisms to deny the gravity of this violence. It is an irony that in an age defined by hype, the only hype that is condemned is one that tries to bring this violence to the centre of our attention. Pointing out that violence has happened before, in other political regimes, that it is an endemic part of the way vulnerable groups, Dalits, Adivasis, increasingly minorities, are put in their place is also no longer an enabling moral insight. Instead of using this history to behove us to take this violence seriously, we use it simply as a way of deflecting attention.

The sins of the past become the perfect excuse for destroying the moral community of the future. The third mechanism is to quarter justice into partisan hues till it disappears from sight. Since X did not condemn violence against Y, their protest on violence against Z must be in bad faith. This argument itself now has become a weapon of psychic warfare to disable any confronting of violence. It is often not even a true description of people’s position, but more a tool to shut them down. Indeed, it is a strange corrosion of the moral order which is focussed on condemnation of each and every act of evil individually; no citizen can possibly deal with every single act of evil in this country. It deflects attention from the underlying institutions and moral principles at work.

These lynchings are fiendishly redefining citizenship. The significance of this violence is not just the number: Whether it is 15 incidents or 50. It is to spread the fear that it can happen at any moment, anywhere. This violence establishes a new political dispensation, where a group of people claim direct sovereignty: They act above formal law and order institutions, they feel entitled to enforce the morality, and their impunity comes from the fact that they can now stand in for the “authentic people.” Although the violence is different in many respects, there is this commonality in those who lynch in the name of cows and those lynching in the name of azadi in Kashmir. Since I speak in the name of the authentic Hindu or the authentic Kashmiri, my violence now has this imprimatur of what I take to be a people’s sovereignty.

The formal institutions of the state will not condemn this violence, or condemn it in half-hearted abstractions, because they have unleashed this politics. When the nation can speak unmediated, if a single leader, or a news anchor can be a stand-in for the nation, each violent citizen will also be emboldened to take on the same role. When the nation is the highest unmediated value, is it any surprise that anything being done in its name becomes higher than law? When every political leader, most television stations, daily peddle the poisonous binary of authentic and non-authentic Indians, is it any surprise that the gau rakshaks, through their act of violence, declare themselves to be defenders of the authentic Indian, as they see it?

Let us make no mistake about this. There will be a lot of mendacious evasions. It will be said that this violence is not over beef. It has to do with some other disputes. Lynchings and vigilante violence have happened before, even under Congress rule. Violence happens across political regimes. But its placement in a normative order also matters. These obvious facts cannot take away one large feature of the current wave. What makes this violence chilling is not what’s in the statistic. It is that it is acquiring an atmosphere of a religious communion about it. It is violence to establish the power of the majority, and to redefine that majority as a political dispensation sees fit. This violence is now united by one single thread, of showing minorities their place. All of us are innocent till proven guilty; minorities, whether on a train, driving a truck, transporting cattle, distributing sweets, are guilty until proven innocent. This violence seeks to alter the fundamental moral and constitutional order: The victim of the lynching is presented as the criminal, while the ideologies that justify this killing enjoy the patronage of the state. This is what makes it induce so much fear. A fear exacerbated by the fact that our public conscience seems to have been all but dismantled.

The metaphysical invocation of India’s diversity, or the examples of personal virtue here and there, should not blind us to the core ideological, institutional and human rights problem this new wave of lynching represents. Narendra Modi may loudly proclaim that he is defending our borders. But his cowardly silences, or abstract gestures, are emboldening the barbarians within. What political dispensation will be able to prevent this list from Akhlaq to Ayub from growing is an open question. But at least we should say, “May the silent be damned.”

Junaid Khan’s brother Shaqir, who was stabbed five times, at AIIMS Junaid Khan’s brother Shaqir, who was stabbed five times, at AIIMS

It was the day after the April 9 parliamentary by-election in Srinagar. Only seven per cent voters had turned out and eight people were killed in related violence. A viral video of CRPF jawans being booed and hustled out of a village was ruling the air waves.

As I watched the video on a friend’s phone in Srinagar, he said: “Look, they could have snatched their rifles, shot them, lynched them, but we don’t do that kind of thing here in Kashmir. Lynching aapke yahan hota hai. Aisa Kashmir mey nahin hota”. His reference point was the lynching of Pehlu Khan in Alwar just days earlier, on April 1.

Last Thursday night, though, that premise changed forever as worshippers at the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar’s Nowhatta surrounded a police officer in plainclothes on the mosque’s precincts, beat him, tore off his clothes, rained stones on him and eventually gored him to death.

One day later, back here in Ballabhgarh, a 15-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death by a group of men on a train. They had taunted him about him being Muslim. His brother, who was also stabbed, survived the attack. The two were returning home after an afternoon spent shopping for the Eid festival in Delhi.

The circumstances of the two incidents could not be more different. One took place on the outskirts of the national capital, against the background of triumphal Hindu majoritarianism that has got a free pass since the BJP swept the polls in 2014 — and which has since been nurtured by BJP governments across north India, in the name of governance priorities like cow protection and anti-beef eating and anti-Romeo squads.

These dozen or so lynchings that have taken place since that horrible night of September 28. 2015, when Mohammed Akhlaque was killed by vigilante mobs in his village near Delhi, may be compared to the blasphemy killings in Pakistan, where the alleged blasphemer was seen burning the Koran – but that’s another story.

The policeman’s lynching in Srinagar, on the other hand, took place against the backdrop of relentless daily violence that has rocked the Kashmir valley since July 2016, after the killing of the Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani.

Decades of growing older under the shadow of the gun has also paved the way for the Valley’s unforgiving “othering”, certainly not along communal lines but aimed at anyone perceived to be a participant in the “Indian” project in Kashmir.

Yet the two incidents cannot be separated. Both dramatically underline the normalization of mob violence and the casual street brutality since the Akhlaq murder, at least across the Hindi-speaking north Indian states. As well as the way in which this civilian mob violence has recently begun to rear its head in the Valley.

As many as 16 policemen have died in J&K this past year, but before Deputy Superintendent of Police Mohammed Ayub Pandith, none at the hands of civilians. Kashmiri men are still joining the police because the job offers a decent salary. If they perceive a danger to themselves, it is from gun-toting militants and gun-toting security forces, not civilians.

In a sense, the two incidents violently mirrored the real world of TV studios and social media, with its spewing of hatred against anyone perceived to be “anti-India, anti-national and anti-Hindutva”. Certainly, the casual public humiliation and excoriation of anyone who does not ride with the current wave of separatism and militancy in Kashmir is exceptional.

But of all the forms of violence that Kashmiris experience in their everyday life, the least expected was the lynching of a fellow Muslim, or even a “suspected Hindu”, that too in the premises of a mosque.

Kashmiri antipathy toward “Hindu India” has grown and expanded on a steady diet of viral videos of lynchings of Muslims suspected of eating beef, ‘smuggling’ cows, and other related perceived crimes. There is little happening today in Kashmir that can provide an alternate narrative, or an alternate image of the government.

In the vacuum, the Kashmiri loathing for the PDP’s alliance with the BJP has grown with each video, as it is accompanied by the fear that a violent Hindutva has reached their doorstep. The alienation “from India” expands geometrically as Kashmiris witness this new street brutality against Muslims elsewhere in the country.

In a way, we become what we hate. India is becoming a Hindu Pakistan. For those brutal minutes in the mosque, there was no difference between the men who killed DSP Pandith and those who killed 15-year-old Junaid Khan returning home after Eid shopping in Delhi.

The manner in which DSP Pandith met his end shows that one mob learns easily from another, borrows the other’s methods, even while hating the other.

Still, in Kashmir, Ayub’s horrific killing has kindled a sense of shame in the wider community; those who have sought to justify the incident are in a minority. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has alienated even her own supporters over the last year, but she spoke for a majority when she expressed her shock at the incident and called it the end of trust.

The lynching of Junaid, on the other hand, has not triggered the widespread outrage that it should have. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has been busy tweeting his own achievements and his connect with citizens even two days after the brutal killing, but could not frame the 140 characters required to condemn it.

Still, that is entirely in keeping with the national silence over the murder of Mohammed Akhlaq nearly two years ago, and the others who have since met a similar end.

It is not how many who said those words ‘Not in my Name’. It is not about how many cities reacted in anger. It’s about a growing tide of Indians, beyond politicians and parties, who with their brave and passionate acts of citizenship are affirming democracy, in the spirit of what democracy is. And the idea of India was reclaimed on the streets of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Allahabad and others on Wednesday.

And the idea of India was reclaimed on the streets of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Allahabad and others on Wednesday.

It started off as a Facebook post by Gurgaon-based film maker Saba Dewan calling for street protests against the tyranny of lynchings in India. And while a spin was given that this was all against Muslim lynchings and not Hindu ones, it is only those who empathise with the lynchers who actually gave a communal colour to the act of true Indians.

India, Hindustan and Bharat met and will meet on the streets of Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai, as well as London, Karachi and Cambridge. Seeing their faces of determination of reclaiming the space of unity, equality and justice, which is sought to be snatched back, there was no room for identifying if they were Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Christians or of any other faith. They were peaceful and they just held placards which had four words which encapsulated the spirit of India. Four words which can counter an entire army of lynch mobs. NOT IN MY NAME. And above all, one placard held aloft by an elderly muslim man said it all, ‘Is it that easy to turn us against each other”. And his fellow Indians replied “Not in my name”.

This was a unique chain protest by Indians who felt a dam had burst. Bottled up emotions about a spate of mob lynchings across the country. It is also a fact that the overwhelming majority of victims of mob attacks recently have been Muslims, but then, this wasn’t a Muslim backlash. It was a peaceful backlash of a true secular India of the common and the not so common, an India that was being taken back from those who stole it, the lynch mobs.

Therefore, when those who have remained silent or even in their warped way justified the lynchings, reacted to this spontaneous initiative, by actually counting the lynchings of 2005 and 2006 (obviously linking it to the Congress rule then) to indicate that this year’s lynchings have gone down, it shames even the word shame.

Are we going to get numbers thrown at us, to justify the spate of killings? Are we going to accept the logic that relatively low number of killings, however brutal, and a part of a progrom, is justified?

An India which said ‘Not In My Name’ is an India we must be proud of.

Such protests help build solidarities.” Our India is where these two Indians took to the streets to protest against the killings of Junaid and Pehlu Khan, defending every Indian’s right to live with dignity.

Shame on those who asked, where were today’s protestors when Kashmiri pundits were getting killed. Every life matters and it must be said that the power of social media and communication allows us to meet for a cause much easier than before.

NEW DELHI: Indian police Saturday said one person has been arrested after a mob stabbed a Muslim teenager to death on suspicion of carrying beef, an offense in many parts of the Hindu-majority country.

Cows are revered by Hindus and slaughtering them as well as possession or consumption of beef is banned in most Indian states, with some imposing life sentences for breaking the law.

Junaid Khan, 15, was traveling from New Delhi on Friday with three of his brothers when a fight erupted over seats.

Between 15 and 20 men pulled out knives and set upon the brothers while making anti-Muslim comments and insisting one of the packets they were carrying contained beef.

While Khan was stabbed to death, his brother Shakir sustained injuries on the throat, chest and hands, police said.

“The fight started over seats. We are looking into the matter and we have arrested one of the accused who is a 35-year-old old man from (northern state of) Haryana,” Ajay Kumar, a government railway police official told AFP.

Khan’s brother Hassem told reporters the mob ignored their repeated pleas that they were not carrying any beef.

“They were pointing at a packet which had food and saying we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef,” Haseem said.

The incident is the latest such attack by Hindu vigilantes in India, where there have been a spate of assaults against Muslims and low-caste Dalits.

In the last two years, nearly a dozen Muslim men have been killed across the country on suspicion of eating beef or smuggling cows.

Critics say vigilantes have been emboldened by the election in 2014 of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.

Last year Modi criticized the cow protection vigilantes and urged a crackdown against groups using religion as a cover for committing crimes.

PM Narendra Modi, during a town hall interaction on Saturday said, that “70-80 per cent are involved in activities which have no place in society and they, therefore, don the mantle of gau rakshaks to hide their ills”.

A day after its general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in condemning activities of “a handful of opportunistic people who in the name of cow protection” are trying to “poison social harmony”, the RSS said Modi should have avoided the remark that such people constitute 80 per cent of gau rakshaks in the country.

It also said the “RSS has always espoused the cause of gau raksha”.

The Prime Minister, during a town hall interaction Saturday to mark two years of MyGov, had asked state governments to prepare a dossier on “those who consider themselves great gau rakshaks” and then said that “70-80 per cent are involved in activities which have no place in society and they, therefore, don the mantle of gau rakshaks to hide their ills”. A day later, speaking in Telangana, Modi again referred to “fake cow protectors” but this time he called them a “handful”.

Speaking to The Indian Express Monday, RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya said: “The 80 per cent remark should have been avoided but the PM later made amends at Hyderabad, saying only a handful of so-called gau rakshaks were fake. And as regards why issue a statement after the Dalit flogging, it should not be seen as a caste or religion issue. The RSS has always espoused the cause of gau raksha.”

Asked about the angry response of the VHP to the PM’s remark, Vaidya said: “All RSS-inspired organisations are autonomous and are free to express their own assessment and opinion.”

The wording of Joshi’s statement Sunday highlights the RSS dilemma. On the one hand, it wants to be seen to be with the Prime Minister on the issue and, on the other, it tries to echo the sentiments of swayamsevaks by striking a different tone on the number of “fake” gau rakshaks. While Modi estimated them to be in the range of “70-80 per cent”,Joshi referred to them as a “handful” (mutthibhar).

“Many swayamsevaks were upset by the PM’s estimate of fake gau rakshaks but he must have had definite inputs, so he was categorical about it. The RSS, which is finding it difficult to control hot-heads in the VHP, was forced to issue a statement saying such people constituted only a handful,” sources in RSS said.

The statements of the Prime Minister and RSS also come in the wake of attacks on Dalits and not Muslims who continue to be targeted by gau rakshaks.“That inference can be drawn by some people,” a functionary of the RSS said, adding “the RSS is more worried about Dalits since it is really trying to rid itself of the Brahmanical face it has come to acquire in public perception”.

“That inference can be drawn by some people,” a functionary of the RSS said, adding “the RSS is more worried about Dalits since it is really trying to rid itself of the Brahmanical face it has come to acquire in public perception”.

The RSS also sees a “conspiracy” in the Una incident. Senior RSS ideologue M G Vaidya said, “The flogging of Dalits at Una seems like a conspiracy to me. As regard the number of fake gau rakshaks, I will go by what Bhaiyyaji has said. The PM may have had his own inputs about their numbers, but so does Bhaiyyaji since he also moves around the country.”

Asked why were statements not issued when some Muslims were attacked and killed, Vaidya said, “The main thing is gau raksha. It is legally enforceable. Hence, nobody should take the law into his hands. Nobody should be subjected to illegal actions.”

INTERNATIONAL beef markets have been surprisingly calm since Friday’s announcement by the US Government that Brazilian chilled and frozen beef imports have been banned until further notice.

Further details behind the suspension made public since Beef Central’s original Friday story (click here to view) suggest the violations the USDA detected in Brazilian beef included abscesses, unidentified foreign material and ‘ingesta,’ a term which can include any feed, liquid or medicine that cattle consumed prior to slaughter.

Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world.

The rejected shipments, totalling about 1000 tonnes, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, the USDA said on Friday.

Reaction in the US market

Following the announcement on Friday, the US imported market was described as ‘quiet’.

A source said sellers put their prices up US2-3c/lb, but buyers were happy to take a ‘wait and see’ approach as the situation remained very uncertain.

“There is no doubt spot imported meat in the US, whether it is from NZ, Australia or Brazil is very tight at present, and any disruption like this, even though small, might see a short-term increase in prices as sellers look to cover commitments should the ban continue over an extended period,” an Australian analyst said. “Most importers I spoke to felt the biggest concerns in the market were more related to those being short-bought on Brazilian grinding meat rather than cuts.”

The head of the Brazilian Meat Exporters Association ABIEC estimated about 120 containers representing about 3000 tonnes of Brazilian meat were in the ‘pipeline’ to the US at the time of the announcement.

Brazil Ag Minister flies to the US

Brazil’s agriculture minister Blairo Maggi announced on Friday (Saturday Australian time) that he will travel to the US to fight the ban on Brazilian beef imports.

Deputy Agriculture Minister Eumar Novacki said the problems laid out by the USDA posed no risk to public health. He told reporters at a news conference that some cattle had adverse reactions to certain vaccines.

He recognised, however, that there were flaws in Brazil’s inspection system, but suggested there could be “commercial motivations” for the US ban. He said US and European authorities had stepped up inspections of Brazilian beef in recent months.

The head of Brazil’s Meat Exporters Association said the US suspension had done more damage to Brazil’s image, than it did in terms of volume beef sales.

He said USDA approval for Brazil’s fresh beef, which was only granted last year, was expected to open the door to bigger fresh beef importers such as Japan and South Korea.

“We worked a long time to open the US market because it is a passport to other markets,” he told media.

Similar concerns raised in EU

Similar problems as those encountered in the US have been occurring in Brazil’s exports to the EU.

Europe has ramped up control checks, leading to the rejection of 108 consignments of Brazilian meat. Of those, 77 were due to presence of salmonella in poultry; four due to the presence of Shiga toxin producing E. coli in beef; two for drug residues in horsemeat; and 25 for other reasons including incorrect certification and cold chain problems.

Stricter checks for all Brazilian meat entering Europe will now remain in force. Authorities had raised concerns about the quality of Brazil’s meat inspection systems four months before Brazil’s recent Weak Meat bribery scandal.

Between May 2 and 12, the EU conducted an audit in Brazilian slaughterhouses and meatpacking companies, reporting a range of critical deficiencies in most sectors, a number of which of a serious nature.

Reacting to the news of the US beef suspension from Brazil, Irish Farmers Association national livestock chair Angus Woods said EU authorities had to take note of the US ban, and remove Brazilian beef from any Mercosur deal.

“Irish and European farmers will be rightly questioning how EU negotiators can continue to engage with the Mercosur countries given this decision by the USDA,” Mr Woods said.

At the beginning of this month, the EU’s Health and Food Security Committee gave Brazil a warning. In a letter to Brazil’s Agriculture Minister, the EU said that Brazil had not tried to regain the trust of its European partners.

Brazil has made some amendments following EU criticisms over the last six years, but this has proved to be insufficient. Currently the EU has symbolically suspended horse meat bans, but broader bans could follow, analysts suggested this week.

Canada’s reaction

Canada has also rejected six shipments of Brazilian beef out of 191 meat shipments since April 10, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

The Canadian agency said it recently blocked imports from one Brazilian plant that did not meet food safety requirements, but is accepting meat from plants that meet its standards.

Contacts with connections with Chinese importers thought China and Hong Kong would monitor the situation in the US and focus on a plant-by-plant evaluation as opposed to a country-wide Brazil ban.

“The decision by other countries so far not to follow the US and take and a ‘wait and see’ approach is understandable,” an Australian analyst told Beef Central today.

“If they did follow the US, and should the approval process of allowing Brazil back into the US take an extended period, then for many countries they might feel bound to follow,” he said. “This in turn could cause major disruptions to supply, for extended periods.”

By adopting a plant-by-plant ban approach, it would enable other countries to maintain flexibility and not be bound by the US’s own decision-making on importing Brazilian beef.

In countries like the EU, the added complexity of negotiating a free trade agreement has undoubtedly given farmer and other lobby groups some ammunition to try to disrupt the negotiations – and in turn has placed the EU negotiators in an awkward position. Hence the desire to also maintain a plant-by-plant monitoring approach potentially takes complication out of the FTA discussions for EU negotiators, the analyst said.

How long will ban last?

“The length of time likely for the US ban remains very unclear, as I am sure the USDA is still trying to determine if this is a systematic failure or isolated cases,” he said.

“If it’s the former, then it could be assumed that the ban might last longer than expected, but if the latter, then the issues might be resolved in a short period of time. It is the unknown timeline of the ban by the USDA that has led to more cautious approach by other countries to head down a similar path to the US,” the analyst said.

“There is no doubt in my mind that should the ban go for an extended period of time there will be an impact on imported spot meat in the US, with potential this will move to an extended premium for imported over domestic grinding meat – at least until the unfilled Brazilian beef commitments are filled.”

“The overall US market is likely to be short lean meat, as a result of last week’s announcement, but not necessarily imported lean meat – therefore domestic lean beef might be used,” Beef Central’s contact said.

“Given how tight imported meat is in the US spot market is at present, then this option lets the importer off the hook because he could be squeezed on trying to source NZ or Australian beef.”

“How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindus in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here.”

This is an excerpt from Gandhi’s prayer discourse of July 25, 1947, from the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, Volume 88, as published online by the Gandhi Heritage Portal.

The Wire first published this article on October 2, 2015, in the light of the shocking incident in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, where a Muslim family was attacked by a murderous mob and Mohammed Akhlaq lynched on the suspicion that they had some beef in their home.

We are republishing it again because of its relevance to current developments.

Rajendra Babu tells me that he has received some 50,000 postcards, between 25,000 and 30,000 letters and many thousands of telegrams demanding a ban on cow-slaughter. I spoke to you about this before. Why this flood of telegrams and letters? They have had no effect.

I have another telegram which says that a friend has started a fast for this cause. In India no law can be made to ban cow-slaughter. I do not doubt that Hindus are forbidden the slaughter of cows. I have been long pledged to serve the cow but how can my religion also be the religion of the rest of the Indians? It will mean coercion against those Indians who are not Hindus.

We have been shouting from the house-tops that there will be no coercion in the matter of religion. We have been reciting verses from the Koran at the prayer. But if anyone were to force me to recite these verses I would not like it. How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindus in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here.

The assumption of the Hindus that India now has become the land of the Hindus is erroneous. India belongs to all who live here. If we stop cow slaughter by law here and the very reverse happens in Pakistan, what will be the result? Supposing they say Hindus would not be allowed to visit temples because it was against Shariat to worship idols? I see God even in a stone but how do I harm others by this belief? If therefore I am stopped from visiting temples I would still visit them. I shall therefore suggest that these telegrams and letters should cease. It is not proper to waste money on them.

I have been long pledged to serve the cow but how can my religion also be the religion of the rest of the Indians? It will mean coercion against those Indians who are not Hindus.

Besides some prosperous Hindus themselves encourage cow-slaughter. True, they do not do it with their own hands. But who sends all the cows to Australia and other countries where they are slaughtered and whence shoes manufactured from cow hide are sent back to India? I know an orthodox Vaishnava Hindu. He used to feed his children on beef soup. On my asking him why he did that he said there was no sin in consuming beef as medicine.

We really do not stop to think what true religion is and merely go about shouting that cow-slaughter should be banned by law. In villages Hindus make bullocks carry huge burdens which almost crush the animals. Is it not cow-slaughter, albeit slowly carried out? I shall therefore suggest that the matter should not be pressed in the Constituent Assembly…

I have been asked, ‘Since in view of the atrocities being perpetuated by Muslims it is difficult to decide which of the Muslims are to be trusted, what should be our attitude towards the Muslims in the Indian Union? What should the non-Muslims in Pakistan do?

I have already answered this question. I again repeat that all the religions of India today are being put to the test. It has to be seen how the various religious groups such as the Sikhs, the Hindus, the Muslims and the Christians conduct themselves and how they carry on the affairs of India. Pakistan may be said to belong to Muslims but the Indian Union belongs to all. If you shake off cowardice and become brave you will not have to consider how you are to behave towards the Muslims. But today there is cowardice in us. For this I have already accepted the blame.

In villages Hindus make bullocks carry huge burdens which almost crush the animals. Is it not cow-slaughter, albeit slowly carried out?

I am still wondering how my 30 years’ teaching has been so ineffective. Why did I assume, to begin with, that non-violence could be a weapon of cowards? Even now if we can really become brave and love the Muslims, the Muslims will have to stop and think what they could gain by practising treachery against us. They will return love for love. Can we keep the crores of Muslims in the Indian Union as slaves? He who makes slaves of others himself becomes a slave. If we answer sword with sword, the lathi with lathi and kick with kick, we cannot expect that things will be different in Pakistan. We shall then lose our freedom as easily as we have gained it…

[Translated from Hindi]

Prarthana Pravachan –I, pp 277-280

Note: The question of banning cow slaughter was debated in the Constituent Assembly and a consensus emerged that there should be no national statute banning the consumption of beef. The goal was instead included in the (non-binding) Directive Principles of State Policy.

Ahmedabad :

Delivering a speech to mark the centenary of the Sabarmati ashram here and 150th birth anniversary of Shrimad Rajchandraji, a guru to Mahatma Gandhi, Modi said unleashing violence against others went against the ideals of the Father of the Nation.





"Killing people in the name of 'gau bhakti' is not acceptable. This is not something Mahatma Gandhi would approve," he said.





"Let's all work together. Let's create the India of Mahatma Gandhi's dreams. Let's create an India our freedom fighters would be proud of," the prime minister said.





"No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands," he said.





The Prime Minister's remarks come against the backdrop of growing incidents of cow vigilantism. A Muslim youth was last week killed on board a Mathura-bound train by people who taunted his family and repeatedly called them "anti-nationals" and "beef eaters".





"Violence never has and never will solve any problem. As a society, there is no place for violence," Modi said.





Thousands of people across the country had yesterday taken to the streets in a citizens' protest named 'Not in My Name' against the recent incidents of mob killings.





Holding placards that read: "Break the Silence", "No Place for Islamophobia" and "Shed Hate not Blood" among others, the protesters had said they had gathered to send out a message that there is a need to unite for a cause.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a stern message to cow vigilantes in the country saying that killing in the name of cow is unacceptable. He was speaking at the centenary celebrations of the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.

“Killing people in the name of cow is unacceptable. No one has the right to take law into his/her hands. We belong to a land of non-violence. Violence is not the solution to any problem,” said the Prime Minister. He added that Mahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, would not approve of such incidents.

“Vinoba Bhave and Mahatma Gandhi have shown the path to practice gau-bhakti,” PM Modi said.

The remarks come in the backdrop of several incidents of lynching and murder of people by self-styled cow vigilante groups over rumours of cow slaughter. The most recent incident was the murder of 15-year-old Junaid Khan by a group of people on a Mathura-bound train in Ballabhgarh in Haryana after an argument escalated over seats. Junaid, who was accompanied by his two brothers, was going back home after Eid shopping when he was mocked over his skull cap and referred to as a ‘beef-eater.’ Five people have been held so far in the incident.

In August last year, the Prime Minister had similarly criticised the actions of self-styled cow vigilantes and asked the States to prepare dossiers on them.

“It makes me angry that people are running shops in the name of cow protection… Some people indulge in anti-social activities at night, and in the day masquerade as cow protectors,” PM Modi said. He added that people who wanted to serve cows should ensure that the animals do not eat plastic.

On Wednesday, demonstrations were carried out by citizens under the banner of ‘Not In My Name’ at Jantar Mantar in Delhi and several other cities across the country protesting the government’s silence over such attacks on Dalits and minorities. People held banners saying ‘All lives matter’ and ‘Muslim lives matter.’

“Unless we speak up, the people who are behind it are by default going to think that they have the majority’s support — which is not true”, Monami Basu, Professor of Economics at Delhi University told indianexpress.com at the protest.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad will mark the return of U.S beef to China this week.

On Friday, the duo will celebrate a U.S. beef export success by returning to China and cutting a ceremonial Nebraska prime rib.

Over the weekend, they will attend events with Chinese officials marking the end of the 13 year old beef ban.

China has emerged as a major beef buyer with imports going from $275 million in 2012 to $2.5 billion last year.

The U.S. is the worlds largest beef producer and the fourth largest exporter.
Global burger joint and India's favorite fast food chain, McDonald's is shutting its 43 outlets out of 55 in Delhi today. The tiff between CPRL (Connaught Plaza Restaurants) and US-headquartered McDonald's has taken a sour turn for the consumers as well as the employees.

Vikram Bakshi, the former managing director of CPRL told ET, "It's unfortunate, but operation of 43 restaurants operated by CPRL has been temporarily suspended."

CPRL operates 168 restaurants in total.

The tiff between Bakshi and McDonald's has led to the shutting down of the outlets.

It was observed that the decision to shut down the outlets was taken via a Skype meeting on Wednesday and could leave 1,700 employees jobless.

But, according to an official statement released by McDonald's India Pvt. Ltd. (MIPL), the services by McDonald's are temporarily suspended for the operations of specific restaurants.

The temporary suspension is due to the expiration of the Eating House Licenses of specific restaurants. However, the Board of the CPRL is currently working to obtain the licenses need to comply with McDonald's regulatory standars.

The brand also ensured that CPRL is retaining the employees of affected restaurants and will pay them their salary during the period of suspension.

Here's the official statement by MIPL:

The former managing director of CPRL was removed from his position in August 2013. Ever since his removal, he was involved in a legal battle with the US-headquatered fast food chain. Bakshi was responsible for dragging McDonald's to Company Law Board (CPL). Although, the CPL verdict is still pending for the particular case.

McDonald's has also been pursuing arbitration against Bakshi in the London Court of International Arbitration.

Shutting down almost 80 per cent of its outlets might cause the American fast food chain to go in great loss, but the restaurant chain decided to do it anyway due to health and regulatory reasons.

It seems like the meal is not going to be that happy for Delhiites after India's favourite burger chain's decision to temporarily drop their cheesy services.

Brazil on Tuesday conceded that the government needs 1,600 more inspectors at meatpacking facilities but also questioned the swift ban imposed by the United States on shipments of fresh Brazilian beef.

Luis Rangel, Brazil's plant and animal health secretary, told Reuters in an interview that Brazilian beef suppliers are still working to adapt to stricter requirements of the U.S market. He said some problems raised by U.S. food safety authorities "would be tolerated in other markets," and that no system was infallible.

Last week, the U.S. government blocked imports of Brazilian fresh beef, less than a year after opening the market to the product. U.S. officials said inspections of arriving shipments uncovered defects such as abscesses, prohibited tissues and unidentified material in the meat.

Excitement abounds for new beef market access in China, but qualified supplies remain tight. Beef leaders say full access to market channels will take time to develop.

“China has tremendous potential for this industry, but it’s a long-term project,” says Derrell Peel, economist, Oklahoma State University. “We’ve got access and now we know the details. There are some restrictions in the short run that really limit the available supply. More importantly, now the market can start to work. Over time we’ll figure out what the restrictions are for specific products and those relations will develop.”

Cattlemen were quick to celebrate the major win—within hours of reopening Chinese markets to U.S. beef on June 12, steaks were on the way. On June 14, Greater Omaha Packing Company sent their first shipment of 40 boxes of ribeyes, tenderloins and New York strip steaks by air freight to a customer in Shanghai.

“We want to know how the process works,” Dan Jensen, Greater Omaha vice president of sales and marketing, told the Lincoln Journal Star. “This will be the first of many shipments.”

Beef exported to China must meet several qualifications, such as being derived from cattle born, raised and slaughtered in the U.S.; traceable to the farm of birth; and derived from cattle less than 30 months of age. China also bans the use of growth promotants, feed additives and chemical compounds, and will conduct residue testing at port of entry.

Product will need to be raised to meet these specifications, starting at the cow-calf level to move through the system, says Katelyn McCullock, economist, American Farm Bureau Federation. “Only a small proportion of commercial beef production would fit the current parameters surrounding this protocol. The premium attached to the Chinese market must warrant those changes."

China’s demand for high-quality beef is substantial.

“We know some U.S. beef has been getting into China unofficially for several years,” Peel says. This means packers might have an idea of what the demands of the process will be; however, it might change when it’s legitimate business, he says.

“We might see some significant numbers in the first months—merely as those unofficial supplies convert into legal flows. So we could see export numbers for China look relatively large and appear impressive,

but we have to check to see it’s not off-setting something that has been shipped through Hong Kong, Vietnam or other places,” Peel says.

China’s market halted in 2003 when the U.S. investigated a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from an imported dairy cow. Up to that point, the U.S. was China’s largest supplier of beef. In 2016, China imported beef products (mostly from Australia) worth up to $2.5 billion.

“I think we’re talking about a multi-year process to really see the potential for this market,” Peel says. “We will see this market expand in 2017 and throughout 2018.”

“Right now, its going to cost more to get ready for this market and to get qualified, relative to the value of the products we are sending over there,” he adds. “But there is tremendous opportunity to grow this market. It just doesn’t happen immediately.”

NEW DELHI: The Rajasthan high court on Wednesday recommended the Centre to declare cow as the national animal of India.The court further suggested that anyone guilty of cow slaughter should be sentenced to life, a steep escalation from the present three years' imprisonment.Judge Mahesh Chandra Sharma made the recommendations while hearing the Hingonia Gaushala matter, a government-run cowshed in Jaipur where over a hundred cows had perished over the span of a few weeks last year.The petition comes at a time when a number of states in the country are protesting the government's decision to impose ban on the slaughter of cattle, primarily cows, for commercial purposes.There are over 8,000 cows at the Hingonia Gaushala which are taken care of by a team of 14 veterinarians, 24 livestock assistants, and about 200 other staff. Reports said the death of the cows was due to alleged lapse in maintenance of the cowshed.The high court has asked for a report on the cowshed every three months and directed UDH Secretary and the municipal commissioner to visit once every month. It has further instructed the forest department to plant 5,000 plants in the cowshed every year.(With inputs from ANI)
PM Narendra Modi, during a town hall interaction on Saturday said, that “70-80 per cent are involved in activities which have no place in society and they, therefore, don the mantle of gau rakshaks to hide their ills”. (Source: PTI File Photo)

A day after its general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in condemning activities of “a handful of opportunistic people who in the name of cow protection” are trying to “poison social harmony”, the RSS said Modi should have avoided the remark that such people constitute 80 per cent of gau rakshaks in the country.

It also said the “RSS has always espoused the cause of gau raksha”.

The Prime Minister, during a town hall interaction Saturday to mark two years of MyGov, had asked state governments to prepare a dossier on “those who consider themselves great gau rakshaks” and then said that “70-80 per cent are involved in activities which have no place in society and they, therefore, don the mantle of gau rakshaks to hide their ills”. A day later, speaking in Telangana, Modi again referred to “fake cow protectors” but this time he called them a “handful”.

Speaking to The Indian Express Monday, RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya said: “The 80 per cent remark should have been avoided but the PM later made amends at Hyderabad, saying only a handful of so-called gau rakshaks were fake. And as regards why issue a statement after the Dalit flogging, it should not be seen as a caste or religion issue. The RSS has always espoused the cause of gau raksha.”

Asked about the angry response of the VHP to the PM’s remark, Vaidya said: “All RSS-inspired organisations are autonomous and are free to express their own assessment and opinion.”

The wording of Joshi’s statement Sunday highlights the RSS dilemma. On the one hand, it wants to be seen to be with the Prime Minister on the issue and, on the other, it tries to echo the sentiments of swayamsevaks by striking a different tone on the number of “fake” gau rakshaks. While Modi estimated them to be in the range of “70-80 per cent”,Joshi referred to them as a “handful” (mutthibhar).

“Many swayamsevaks were upset by the PM’s estimate of fake gau rakshaks but he must have had definite inputs, so he was categorical about it. The RSS, which is finding it difficult to control hot-heads in the VHP, was forced to issue a statement saying such people constituted only a handful,” sources in RSS said.

The statements of the Prime Minister and RSS also come in the wake of attacks on Dalits and not Muslims who continue to be targeted by gau rakshaks.“That inference can be drawn by some people,” a functionary of the RSS said, adding “the RSS is more worried about Dalits since it is really trying to rid itself of the Brahmanical face it has come to acquire in public perception”.

“That inference can be drawn by some people,” a functionary of the RSS said, adding “the RSS is more worried about Dalits since it is really trying to rid itself of the Brahmanical face it has come to acquire in public perception”.

The RSS also sees a “conspiracy” in the Una incident. Senior RSS ideologue M G Vaidya said, “The flogging of Dalits at Una seems like a conspiracy to me. As regard the number of fake gau rakshaks, I will go by what Bhaiyyaji has said. The PM may have had his own inputs about their numbers, but so does Bhaiyyaji since he also moves around the country.”

Asked why were statements not issued when some Muslims were attacked and killed, Vaidya said, “The main thing is gau raksha. It is legally enforceable. Hence, nobody should take the law into his hands. Nobody should be subjected to illegal actions.”

While police forces in north India have been criticised for being silent spectators when people are being harassed and thrashed by so-called cow vigilantes, the Tamil Nadu Police does not seem to be in any confusion on what their role is in such a situation.

A video that has gone viral over the past day shows the Tamil Nadu taking a right wing group to task for harassing a farmer. The farmer was travelling from Manaparai in Tiruchirapalli to Pollachi with seven calves when he was stopped at the temple town of Pazhani by a Hindu group. The group of cow vigilantes routed the vehicle to a police station and complained that the calves were to be traded for slaughter.

By then, members of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Party and other Communist parties arrived at the scene and a debate ensued. While the other parties stressed that the man was taking the calves for farming purposes, the cow vigilantes did not agree. The debate took a turn for the worse when the two groups became violent and attacked each other.

has exceeded as the world's biggest exporter of buffalo meat, thanks to the recent ban imposed on the sale and transportation of live animals across the country.

Data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed India, and together had 58.7 per cent of the world beef market in 2015, with the highest at 23.5 per cent (up from 20.8 per cent in 2014), followed by and

However, effective May 26, the Union environment ministry imposed a ban on sale and purchase of cattle for slaughter at all animal markets. It led to closure of slaughter houses, an already ongoing process — for instance, after the change in government of earlier in the year, this was already happening.

“The entire work is at a standstill. After banning sale of live animals, their transportation has also been attacked by groups of people in various states. So, not only sale and purchase but also slaughtering and export of has stopped. has, therefore, lost almost the entire export market to Brazil, and the US. Of this, will gain the most,” said Arshad Ali Quddus, proprietor of Al Quddus Sons International, a Delhi-based exporter.

Data compiled by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda) showed India’s export at 1.33 million tonnes worth $3.93 billion for 2016-17, from 1.31 mt valued at $4.07 bn the previous year. About half the export went to Vietnam, followed by (10 per cent) and Egypt (eight per cent). says export declined by 11.4 per cent from a year before to 86,119 tonnes this April, first month of the 2017-18 financial year.

UP, with 28 per cent of the buffalo population, was the leading producing state, followed by Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

Of 41 slaughter houses in Maharashtra, says R R Kamble, deputy commissioner of at the Government of Maharashtra, only 11 Apeda-registered ones are operational.

The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court has stayed the central government’s banning of sale of live animals.

Hence, trading and slaughtering of animals in some parts still continues. With the end of the Ramzan month, demand for has surged across the country, to Rs 220 a kg, around 40 per cent up from pre-ban days.

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, the infighting between Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), the 50:50 local joint venture between Vikram Bakshi and the US-headquartered McDonald's that operates the fast food chain in north and east India, and the global burger giant took an ugly turn with the CPRL board deciding to shut down 43 out of 55 restaurants in Delhi from Thursday."It's unfortunate, but operation of 43 restaurants operated by CPRL has been temporarily suspended," said Vikram Bakshi, former managing director of CPRL, which operates 168 restaurants.Bakshi is still on the CPRL board along with his wife. McDonald's has two representatives on the CPRL board. The decision to close down the outlets was taken during a board meeting via Skype on Wednesday morning.While the estranged joint venture partner declined to share reasons for closure, highly-placed sources disclosed that CPRL failed to get the mandatory regulatory health licences renewed because of the infighting between Bakshi and McDonald's. The move, they point out, will render over 1,700 employees jobless.Bakshi, who was dramatically ousted in August 2013 as managing director of CPRL, has been embroiled in a protracted legal fight with McDonald's, dragging the world's largest fast food chain to the Company Law Board (CLB), which is yet to announce its verdict. McDonald's has been pursuing arbitration against Bakshi in the London Court of International Arbitration. Westlife Development Ltd, through subsidiary Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd (HRPL), owns the master rights for the west and south India operations of McDonald's and runs 242 restaurants.The closure, reckon marketing and branding experts, will hurt McDonald's, which has been sliding in India since it was dethroned by pizza brand Domino's from pole position in 2013 as the largest quick service restaurant (QSR) chain in the country."It's a body blow for the brand," said Ashita Aggarwal, head of marketing at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research.It might well turn out to be precursor to the final nail in the coffin of the American fast food chain that made Indians graduate from roadside vada pavs to branded burgers, she adds.Brand strategist Harish Bijoor contends that unless McDonald's sorts out its legal battle, things might worsen. "Every passing day is a slur on the front-end brand," he says, adding that there is nothing really bigger than the brand.

China removed an old bunker of the Indian Army located at the tri-junction of India, China and Bhutan in Sikkim by using a bulldozer after the Indian side refused to accede to its request to dismantle it, according to official sources.

The incident that took place in June first week in Doka La general area in Sikkim led to a face-off between the two forces, triggering tension in the Sikkim section of the border, the sources said on Wednesday.

China is believed to have not taken kindly to India building many new bunkers and upgrading older ones along the border in Sikkim in the recent past to augment its defences against the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the sources said.

Of the 3,488-km-long border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim.

Beijing is also upset with New Delhi over the recent visit of the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh, the sources said, adding they were also trying to escalate tension in the forward areas, including in Sikkim, even though the border in the Northeastern State is demarcated.

The Sikkim government has sent a report to the Central government giving details of the situation along the border following the stand-off in Doka La.

The first batch of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims, comprising about 50 people, returned from the Nathu La border post as the stand-off between India and China continues.

The pilgrims returned to Gangtok on June 23 after staying in Nathu La for three days awaiting permission from the Chinese side to undertake onward journey.

The second batch did not move from Gangtok while pilgrims were told to go home as the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage is unlikely to continue this year via Nathu La.

The Sikkim route to Mansarovar, which is in Tibet, was thrown open to public in 2015.

The visas for the third batch, comprising about 50 pilgrims, are not given yet. A total of 8-10 batches were supposed to go for the pilgrimage through Nathu La this year.

Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi said on Tuesday that 100 pilgrims were sent back by China despite they having a Chinese visa.

The sources said the Chinese side has mentioned a broken bridge as being the reason for the pilgrims not being able to cross into Tibet for the annual yatra.

Sikkim is a part of the middle sector and experts have been warning the government of increased Chinese activities in this area.

China on Wednesday termed the construction of a road in the Sikkim sector “legitimate”, asserting that it was being built on Chinese territory that neither belongs to India nor Bhutan and no other country has the right to interfere.

China on Tuesday lodged a protest with India over the alleged “crossing of boundary” by its troops in the Sikkim sector and demanded their immediate withdrawal, as Beijing warned that future visits of Indian pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar will depend on the resolution of the standoff.

The last such transgression happened in Sikkim in November 2008 when Chinese soldiers destroyed some makeshift Indian Army bunkers there.
Apparently Los Angeles isn’t interested in locations of New York’s greatest restaurants. Writer Joel Stein penned a piece for Los Angeles Magazine this week saying that he doesn’t want outposts of star establishments like Cosme or The Nomad in LA. He loves restaurants like The Spotted Pig and Jean Georges when he’s in New York — but that doesn’t mean they should be transported to the West Coast. He argues:

[When] I eat in a city, I want to experience the terroir. In Kyoto I crave precision; in Barcelona I crave invention; in Indianapolis I crave being anywhere else. Why anybody in Tokyo would go to its Grand Central Oyster Bar outpost to mimic the experience of quickly slurping bluepoints before running to make the train to Ronkonkoma is one of a million things I don’t understand about that city. By simply mimeographing their Manhattan restaurants, these New York chefs mistake us for Vegas, which is Epcot for Americans who are not interested in other countries.

He adds that the restaurateurs are welcome to open LA-specific, farm-to-table restaurants in California, just not new locations of their New York ones.

Fair point, Joel! But here’s some advice from New York food writers to LA food writers: Know the restaurateurs before you knock them. Stein mentions that he doesn’t visit several LA outposts of restaurants like Tao and 21 Club, but Eater New York will counter that those places don’t have strong culinary reputations, anyway.

Meanwhile, the other chefs that Stein mentions, like Enrique Olvera of Cosme and Daniel Humm of the Nomad, obsessively care about seasonality. In fact, our bet is that the lucky ducks of Los Angeles may even end up experiencing better versions of these chefs’ restaurants due to superior access to produce in California. The Nomad team has already noted that they plan on making use of the local bounty.

Obviously, quality and locality won’t be clear until the restaurants actually open and the dust settles. But give it some time, man.
“One needs not only to protest, but to record our complete anguish,” said Amitabha Pande, a retired civil servant who voted for Narendra Modi in 2014, in the hope that as prime minister he would modernize India’s economy. He said his faith in Mr. Modi collapsed the next year, when the prime minister failed to condemn the lynching of Mohammad Ikhlaq in the village of Dadri.

“He has forgotten the fundamentals of the Constitution that he was supposed to uphold, which is the right to life,” Mr. Pande said. “The fact that he did not come out openly and condemn the Dadri murder, that is when I decided this man does not deserve to be here.”

The message seemed to have penetrated the highest levels of government, because on Thursday, in an address at the ashram where Gandhi established his nonviolence movement, Mr. Modi issued a rare condemnation of the vigilante killings. He said that cows must be protected, but within limits.

“Do we get the right to kill a human being?” he said. “Is this devotion to the cow? Is this cow protection? This cannot be the path of respected Bapuji,” he said, referring to Gandhi.

“Today, when I hear that in the name of the cow someone has been killed, I say the law should take its course; human beings have no right to take the law into their hands,” he said.

Unlike Hindu-Muslim riots, which have become less frequent in recent decades, lynchings are not counted systematically in India, nor are the death tolls dramatic enough to register to most Indians as a national crisis.

But it is clear that killings related to beef-eating or the abuse of cows, which many Hindus consider sacred, have increased in frequency since Mr. Modi was elected, according to an analysis of news coverage by IndiaSpend, a data journalism initiative. Of 63 attacks recorded since 2010, 61 took place under Mr. Modi’s government. Twenty-four out of the 28 people killed in the attacks were Muslim. During the first six months of 2017, there were 20 cow- or beef-related attacks, a jump from the same period in 2016.

There is no evidence that the violence has politically damaged Mr. Modi, who remains extremely popular across a variety of demographic groups. Indeed, many Hindus who came out to protest said they had friends and family who shrugged off the killings as justified by India’s history of invasion by Muslims.

“They are pretty indifferent,” said Shivani Kasumra, 20, a university student, of her own middle-class relatives. “They say this is retribution, that they are terrorists, and that they will convert Hindus to Islam. This is a common Hindu sentiment. Somehow they feel wronged.”

In Delhi, the activists gathered on a street set aside for public protest, and they listened as Mohammad Asaruddin, a relative of the 15-year-old killed last week, read a letter in Hindi, which he said contained a last message to the victim’s mother.

“Dear Ma, I am home,” it said. “You wanted me to buy new clothes from Delhi, but fate has landed me in heaven, where you don’t have marauding mobs. I am home. Yours, Junaid.”

Many reporters had not visited the street for several years, since the vast anticorruption movement that helped sweep the Indian National Congress party out of power. Among the protesters were a number of figures shut out from the new right-wing order, including Swami Agnivesh, a Hindu holy man staunchly associated with Congress party causes; a transgender woman who introduced herself as Vqueeram; and Tehseen Poonawalla, a political trend-watcher and the debonair son of an industrialist. Two hours later, they filed out into the humid darkness, murmuring hopefully to one another about the movement they hoped would grow out of the event.

But the more realistic among them acknowledged that Mr. Modi faces no formidable political opposition and is likely to win a second five-year term in 2019. Shivam Vij, the deputy editor of HuffPost India, said in advance that protesting the killings was a futile exercise and that he would not pretend otherwise.

“It does no damage whatsoever to Modi and his party, because what this protest says is, ‘Muslims are getting lynched,’ and a lot of Hindutvas out there will say, ‘That’s the point,’ ” Mr. Vij said, referring to far-right Hindus. “Society at large is turning right-wing. How long that crest is going to be is the most interesting question, and the fact is nobody knows. Not anytime soon.”

The long-standing dispute between McDonald's and Vikram Bakshi, former MD of local venture partner Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) has reached a conclusion with the CPRL board deciding to down shutters on 43 of its 55 outlets in New Delhi, in effect costing 1,700 jobs.

CPRL is a 50-50 local joint venture between Vikram Bakshi and the US-headquartered McDonald's that operates the fast food chain in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

Sources told the Economic Times the CPRL was unable to renew the mandatory health licences because of the dispute between Bakshi and McDonald’s.

Bakshi, who was unhappy having been removed as the MD, dragged the American-giant fast food company to the Company Law Board (CLB).

He continues to be a Director at the CPRL with 50 percent stake. The fast-food company is still pursuing arbitration against Bakshi in the London Court of International Arbitration. The verdict is yet to be declared.

CPRL controls the restaurants spread across north and east regions of India. Westlife Development Ltd, under the Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd (HRPL), control the west and south India operations of McDonald's.

With two representatives of McDonald's, the conclusion to shut 43 outlets was taken in a board meeting via Skype yesterday.

In total, there are 55 restaurants in the capital. McDonald's,which is spread across the country with over 500 restaurants, gives jobs to around at least 40 per outlet.

McDonald's, which was once the pillar for quick service, lost it's position to Domino's in 2013. The closure of the outlets can hurt McDonald's business as it caters to more than 5,000,000 customers across India everyday.

Deforestation in India is the widespread destruction of major forests in India. In just 30 years, India has lost large forests to 23,716 industrial projects . Just like cow vigilants our country needs tree soldiers to protect our forests before they are destroyed in the name of development.

New Delhi: Much to the discomfort of consumers, retail tomato prices in the national capital have skyrocketed by up to 65 per cent to Rs 60-70 per kg in a fortnight due to crop damage in producing states.

The prices have risen sharply in other metros as well.

Tomato is available at Rs 50 a kg in Kolkata, Rs 40-45 in Chennai and Rs 35-40 in Mumbai, trade data showed.

It is being sold at Rs 60 at Safal outlets run by Mother Dairy in the national capital and Rs 45-48 on online platforms of Grofers and Nature's Basket.

Meanwhile, the central government said the price rise in tomato is a "seasonal phenomena" and it is keeping a close watch on the price movement.

"Tomato is a perishable item. We are keeping a close watch on prices. The states have also been told to be vigilant so that there is no artificial shortage of supplies and price hike," Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told PTI.

Even the price data maintained by the ministry also showed a sharp increase in prices of tomato in the last one week.

Wholesale traders in Delhi attributed the rising price trend in tomato to tight supplies owing to the crop damage because of rains in Haryana and other producing states.

"More than 70 per cent of the tomato crop has been damaged due to excess rains followed by heat in Haryana, one of the key suppliers of the produce to Delhi," said Ashok Kaushik, President of the Tomato Merchants Association in Azadpur, Asia's largest wholesale market for fruits and vegetables.

The tomato crop in some parts of Haryana has rotten because of the rains. So, the price for good quality tomato is high, he said, adding that some quantities are coming in from Shimla in Himachal Pradesh.

The supply shortage and price rise are also witnessed in other parts of the country, Kaushik said, adding that the tomato crop in some parts of South India has been damaged due to rains, leading to price increase.

"Prices quoted were so high that it was unviable to bring tomato from the South. In fact, UP and Maharashtra are supplying tomato to southern states at present," he said.

At Azadpur, tomato prices have jumped to Rs 20-50 depending on the quality. Prices a fortnight ago were ruling at Rs 5-15.

The country's tomato production is estimated to be higher by 15 per cent at 187 lakh tonnes in 2016-17 crop year (July- June), as per the government estimate.
Far away from the photo ops and boasts of Digital India, democratic India was lynched to death. The prime minister, on his visit to Ireland, chose to take a dig at secularism in India. While a bare hour away from the Indian capital city Delhi, a Muslim man was bashed to death with bricks by a mob over a rumour that he had eaten beef. The mob had been instigated by a priest who declared from a temple that the man, 50-year-old Mohd Akhlaque, had eaten beef and thereby hurt Hindu sentiments. To avenge the rumoured death of a cow, a human being was done to death.

What is bizarre is the fact that in the eyes of the anti-secular discourse in India - a discourse of leaders of the ruling BJP, the Sangh Parivar family of assorted Hindu majoritarian groups, and sections of the media - it is the victim who is the accused.

For instance, a headline in the Hindi daily Amar Ujala described the incident thus: "Man accused of killing an animal dies, followed by a ruckus" (Pashuvadh ke aaropi ki maut, bawaal). Look at the way this line uses the word "killing" for the purported cow, while describing the murder by a lynch mob as a "death". And the way outrage and anger at the lynching is trivialised by the use of the word "bawaal", which conveys an unseemly ruckus.

A former MLA of India's ruling party BJP has similarly declared that those arrested for the killing are "innocent kids" who got "excited" by the grave crime of eating beef. An activist of my party, the CPIML, visited the family of the victim today, in the Noida hospital where they stand vigil over the victim's son Danish who has survived the lynching but is still in a coma, and likely to suffer brain damage.

Akhlaque was an ironsmith who fashioned agricultural implements. He had managed to educate his children. His eldest son is in the Air Force as ground staff, and 21-year-old Danish was also studying to get into the Air Force like his brother. Their sister was witness to the terror of a mob breaking down their door, beating her grandmother, mother and herself before dragging off Akhlaque and Danish. She ran from one neighbour to another begging for help, but none came forward. In vain she insisted that the meat in their fridge was mutton not beef. The mob wanted blood, Muslim blood, and the minor detail of whether he'd eaten beef or mutton or otherwise violated the codes of the Hindu-Rashtra-to-be, mattered little.

Some members of the mob have been arrested. But the real leaders of the lynch mob don't live in Dadri alone. For the past couple of months, BJP-ruled states have gone on a rampage, banning meat during a Jain festival. Bans on beef have been longer lasting, in several BJP-ruled states. Modi himself, in his speeches during the parliamentary polls, referred to the meat industry as a "pink revolution", implying that Muslims were murdering cattle, especially cows. BJP and RSS leaders have made the phrase "gow hatya" (cow murder) popular, instead of cow slaughter.

Ever since the Muzaffarnagar communal violence that paved Modi's path to power, western UP has been a seething cauldron of prejudice and hatred against Muslims, kept on a slow fire and brought to a boil now and then by the Sangh Parivar.

In 2002, five Dalits were lynched to death in Jhajjar, Haryana, by a frenzied mob. VHP leader Giriraj Kishore Singh, a veteran member of the RSS family that makes no secret of holding the reins of the Modi government, then answered the question "Is the life of a cow more important than that of the Dalits?" with these many words: "According to our shastras, the life of a cow is very precious (Shastron ke hisab se, gau ka jeevan bahut moolya hai)".

Since Muzaffarnagar, ironically, the Sangh Parivar has tried to mobilise Dalits too on an anti-Muslim plank, willing them to forget that the RSS has been as violent to the Dalits as it has been to Muslims and women.

In the vocabulary of the BJP and RSS, simple human actions of eating and loving are transformed into crimes. Eating beef or even non-vegetarian food (two-thirds of India is non-vegetarian and many communities and regions in India relish beef) is called murder, while love can be called rape or jihad if a Hindu woman has fallen for a Muslim man. The lynchings, murders or kidnappings done to avenge the cow or the Hindu woman who has eloped with a Muslim man are justified: "They kill our mother, the cow; they rape or steal our daughters; they provoke us." Recall that Modi's right-hand man Amit Shah in his election speeches in Western UP after the Muzaffarnagar episode, openly said, "No one wants to riot, but riots happen only to take revenge on the community that rapes our mothers and daughters."

BJP national president Amit Shah had made communally inciteful speeches in the wake of Muzaffarnagar riots.

It is this toxic politics that killed Akhlaque. A politics that declares India to be a Hindu Nation, and brands every Muslim as a terrorist - a lustful love terrorist or a killer of cows.

Less than a week ago, in Kanpur in UP, a Muslim man was lynched to death because it was rumoured that he was a "Pakistani terrorist". In both Kanpur and Dadri, what were the police doing while a mob gathered and beat them to death? These episodes also underline the hollowness and cynicism of what passes for dominant "secular" politics in India. UP is ruled by the Samajwadi Party, which justifies every bid for power in the name of being a secular alternative to the BJP. But the SP governmentt allowed Muslims to be massacred and made homeless in Muzaffarnagar and then callously evicted the victims from refugee camps. The same government does not bat an eye when two Muslims are killed by communal mobs in one week in UP. Can such a party and a government really be called secular?

In 1937, in the USA, Abel Meeropol wrote this powerful poem against the serial lynching of black men who would be killed (often on the pretext of raping a white woman) and hung from trees:

Southern trees bear a strange fruit,

Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,

The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,

Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,

Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,

For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,

Here is a strange and bitter crop.

The spate of killings of black youth in the USA today remind us that the lynchings continue, with the difference that it's now the police who do the killing. These killings, as those lynchings, are all justified on flimsy pretexts and vague suspicions that claim the victim was in some way threatening to society.

Will India wake up to at least recognise the strange and bitter fruit of Muslim men - tortured or killed in police custody as "terrorists", hanged to death by the State on thin evidence to avenge the "collective conscience of the nation" (a phrase coined by the Supreme Court to disguise a lynching), publicly stripped or humiliated by a mob for loving a Hindu woman, or lynched for "eating beef"?

US citizens who hit the streets in thousands to declare that #BlackLivesMatter have done much to redeem their country and fight racism. Will Indian citizens say no to lynch mobs and declare that #MuslimLivesMatter?
After the announcement of international yoga day by Narendra modi, not only people, but cows in India also have started doing yoga every day. The primary reason was to get peace of mind from the controversy and protests, that have been raised due to beef ban issue in India.

Since the cows were doing yoga everyday, the milk men were unable to get milk from the cows at expected time. Also they complain that, day by day, the number of hours the cows performing yoga is increasing since the beef ban protest is also increasing around the country day by day.

Handcarts used for transporting meat are seen parked at an abattoir during a strike against a ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks in Mumbai on March 23, 2015

Handcarts used for transporting meat are seen parked at an abattoir during a strike against a ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks in Mumbai on March 23, 2015 Danish Siddiqui—Reuters

India's exports of beef are on the rise even as several states expand their bans on the slaughter of cows and bullocks, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

India has been the largest exporter of beef in the world since last year, and has further widened its lead over second-ranked Brazil with a projected total of 2.4 million tons exported in 2015 against Brazil's 2 million.

The USDA report, released earlier this month, predicts that global beef exports overall will rise to a record 10.2 million tons, 3% higher than the October 2014 forecast.

Beef has also overtaken basmati rice as India's largest agricultural food export in terms of value, according to data from the country's Agricultural and Processed Food Products' Export Development Authority, cited by the Economic Times newspaper.

Although the slaughter of cows, sacred for the Hindus that make up India's majority population, has long been banned in several parts of the country, states like Maharashtra — one of its largest — recently expanded the ban to include bulls and bullocks as well. However, since India's exports are composed entirely of water-buffalo meat or carabeef, the bans will not affect the figures cited in the report.

"It could bring an end to illegal slaughter and raise the price for buffalo meat, thus proving to be beneficial for companies like us who are engaged in legal slaughter and export of buffalo meat," Priya Sud, a partner at New Delhi–based Al Noor Exports, told the Times.
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Cattle ranchers in Brazil are demanding an overhaul of the vaccination program against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), including suspending it in some parts of the country, to tackle health problems raised by the United States last week when it banned Brazilian fresh beef imports.

The CNPC, a national council of cattle ranchers, asked the government, which oversees the vaccination program, to halve the doses, change the place where vaccines are administered on the animals from muscle to just beneath the skin, and to eliminate a substance called saponin from the vaccines.

Brazil, home to the world’s largest cattle herd, has for decades required ranchers to administer FMD vaccines twice a year to the animals, aiming to eradicate an illness that has in the past prevented its beef from entering valued export markets.

The market for FMD vaccines is estimated by CNPC to be worth 500 million reais ($151 million) per year.

The largest producers are locally listed firm Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA, Boehringer Ingelheim do Brasil Química e Farmacêutica, a subsidiary of German firm Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, and Ceva Saúde Animal Ltda, the local unit of France’s Ceva Santé Animale SA [NEINVA.UL].

The United States suspended imports of Brazilian fresh beef last week, saying a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks. One of the main problems were abscesses, which Brazilian ranchers blame on the vaccines.

CNPC also said Brazil should scrap the vaccination in 12 states that are home to around 120 million heads which have not reported a FMD case in more than 20 years.

“We can’t continue the program as it is,” CNPC head Sebastião Guedes told Reuters on Thursday.

He hopes the U.S. ban would lead the government to listen to the suggestions for changes regarding vaccination.

Brazil’s agriculture ministry opened an investigation into the problems, aiming to also check possible adverse reactions to the vaccines.

The producers declined to comment individually, saying the industry association Sindan would should answer questions on their behalf.

Sindan on Thursday defended the country-wide vaccination, saying ending it in some states could put the whole herd under risk due to lack of vaccination in some of Brazil’s neighbors such as Venezuela.

It again denied infections or abscesses were a possible reaction to the vaccine, saying they would be likely linked to inappropriate handling of the process, such using dirty or damaged needles.

Does organic mean non-GMO and is organic food safer and more nutritious?

With the health risks associated with genetically modified organisms (GMOs), organic products are gaining more popularity among consumers and producers. However, with the anti-GMO labeling policies in America, even if you shop at a local organic store, you need to rely on your eyes and read the labels carefully.

Many of our readers have asked: Does organic mean GMO free?

If a product has “USDA Certified Organic” label on its package, then it is usually non-GMO. However, the following classifications are used for organic products:

100% Organic:

This is the ONLY label used for products that are made with 100% GMO-free and 100% organic ingredients. If a product is labeled “100% organic”, then all the ingredients including even salt must be organic and non-GMO.

Certified USDA Organic:

A product is USDA certified organic, if 95% of its ingredients (by weight) are organic. The remaining 5% could have synthetic additives and preservatives but it’s among substances that are approved by USDA. Here are the lists of substances that are allowed or banned in USDA list. USDA organic are usually GMO-free and here is the policy memorandum of USDA about questions or concerns regarding the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) under the U.S. National Organic Standards.

Made with Organic Ingredients or Contains Organic Ingredients:

This means that up to 70% of the ingredients in the product are organic. However, these products cannot use USDA Certified Organic label and are NOT usually non-GMO. In other words, they do most certainly contain some GMO ingredients.

So is USDA organic GMO-free?

As I mentioned, 95% of the ingredients in a product should be organic for a product to be sealed as USDA Certified Organic.

So, the question is how about the other 5%?

Well, that answer could very well depend on the product.

USDA has listed two common ingredients including non-organic soy lecithin and non-organic cornstarch in the acceptable list. There are other surprises in the USDA organic list and that’s use of antibiotics in organic apples and pear in order to control fire blight. However, according to OrganicConsumers.org, there are other ways to control fire blight without using antibiotics. In fact, U.S. growers exporting to the European Union (E.U.) comply with the E.U. rule that says apples and pears must be produced without antibiotics to be sold as organic.

There is also GMO contamination …

USDA Organic Certification mostly considers the process of growing food (no use of pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, hormones and antibiotics) and NOT the final product. Recently, USDA approved GMO alfalfa that is pollinated by insects. So, there is a chance that organic crops could have been contaminated with GMO ingredients via cross-pollination, winds, insects and birds.

In fact, with all the restrictions on export or growing GMOs in many countries, GMOs are sneaking into their food supply. For example, between the years 2006 and 2007, three varieties of unapproved GM rice owned by Bayer CropScience sneaked into the US commercial rice exports in more than 30 different countries.

Also, recently, Oregon farmers suffered depressed prices of wheat due to discovery of illegal GM wheat resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup. Shortly after countries like South Korea, Japan and EU banned the import of US wheat. Other countries including Denmark, Peru and Venezuela are also joining 30 other countries that have already banned GMOs.

Is there another way to avoid GMOs besides buying certified organic?

Another way to avoid GM foods is to look for products that have been certified by Non-GMO project. However, as the threats of GMOs grow, there are no guarantees that products with non-GMO project label are 100% GMO free. However, be aware that non-GMO project label doesn’t mean that the product is organic whereas USDA certified organic means that up to 95% of the ingredients in the product are both organic and GMO free.

Buy Certified Organic anyways:

As explained, purchasing certified organic might not be perfect and could have its own flaws, but at this point, buying “USDA Certified Organic” is one of best and most effective ways to avoid GMOs and other toxins. You might see other non-GMO labels on the products, but at this point, there are no other certified programs. So, consumers should be aware that other non-GMO labels are based on the producer’s verification of his/her products.

How about Natural labels?

The definition of “Natural” on a product doesn’t mean ANYTHING and has no legal meaning since non-organic producers cannot label their products as USDA organic. Any product you see that uses the terms “All-Natural” or “Natural” could have pesticides and GMO ingredients.

So, why you should eat organic?

According to organicconsumers.org, organic foods have higher level of nutrients like beta carotene, powerful antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, fatty acids and flavonoids.

Organic foods do not also have any additives like MSG, HFCS, cancer-causing preservatives (like sodium nitrate), artificial sweeteners like aspartame and heavy metals and toxins like mercury.

Eating certified organic can lower the chances of health problems including autism, learning difficulty, cancer, heart disease, allergies, migraines, dementia and hyperactivity.

Organic foods are also safer than GMO and conventional foods:

Recently we wrote an article about systemic pesticides and how they cannot be washed off from foods and they remain inside the plant’s tissues. Also, more than 400 chemicals are used in conventional farming and neonicotinoid group of pesticides also known as endocrine disrupters are linked to cancer and asthma and colony collapse of bees.

Organic farming also prohibits use of rBGH growth hormones linked to early puberty and breast and prostate cancer. Free range meat is from organic animals that are not fed on manure, byproducts of corn ethanol production, and arsenic. Eating organic reduces the chances of Alzheimer’s and human version of mad cow disease.

Organic foods are not also fertilized with toxic sewage sludge or coal waste and contain less illness inducing bacteria like salmonella. Click here to find out the top 10 reasons why organic foods are cheaper than GMO and conventional foods.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) – Cattle ranchers in Brazil are demanding an overhaul of the vaccination program against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), including suspending it in some parts of the country, to tackle health problems raised by the United States last week when it banned Brazilian fresh beef imports.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Cattle ranchers in Brazil are demanding an overhaul of the vaccination program against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), including suspending it in some parts of the country, to tackle health problems raised by the United States last week when it banned Brazilian fresh beef imports.

The CNPC, a national council of cattle ranchers, asked the government, which oversees the vaccination program, to halve the doses, change the place where vaccines are administered on the animals from muscle to just beneath the skin, and to eliminate a substance called saponin from the vaccines.

Brazil, home to the world's largest cattle herd, has for decades required ranchers to administer FMD vaccines twice a year to the animals, aiming to eradicate an illness that has in the past prevented its beef from entering valued export markets.

The market for FMD vaccines is estimated by CNPC to be worth 500 million reais ($151 million) per year.

The largest producers are locally listed firm Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA, Boehringer Ingelheim do Brasil Química e Farmacêutica, a subsidiary of German firm Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, and Ceva Saúde Animal Ltda, the local unit of France's Ceva Santé Animale SA [NEINVA.UL].

The United States suspended imports of Brazilian fresh beef last week, saying a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks. One of the main problems were abscesses, which Brazilian ranchers blame on the vaccines.

CNPC also said Brazil should scrap the vaccination in 12 states that are home to around 120 million heads which have not reported a FMD case in more than 20 years.

"We can't continue the program as it is," CNPC head Sebastião Guedes told Reuters on Thursday.

He hopes the U.S. ban would lead the government to listen to the suggestions for changes regarding vaccination.

Brazil's agriculture ministry opened an investigation into the problems, aiming to also check possible adverse reactions to the vaccines.

The producers declined to comment individually, saying the industry association Sindan would should answer questions on their behalf.

Sindan on Thursday defended the country-wide vaccination, saying ending it in some states could put the whole herd under risk due to lack of vaccination in some of Brazil's neighbors such as Venezuela.

It again denied infections or abscesses were a possible reaction to the vaccine, saying they would be likely linked to inappropriate handling of the process, such using dirty or damaged needles.

The latest lynching report comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday condemned killing of people in the name of "Gau bhakti" and said that it is not acceptable.

He was giving his speech at Sabarmati Ashram during the centenary celebrations in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

"Killing people in the name of Gau Bhakti is not acceptable. This is not something Mahatma Gandhi would approve of," said PM Modi.

China removed a ban on shipments of some U.S. beef products, opening up the trade for the first time since 2003 as the country sees a surge in imports of the meat.

The ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef and boneless beef for livestock under 30 months has been removed, with conditions, effective immediately, according to a statement on Thursday from the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. Imports must follow requirements under China’s traceability, inspection and quarantine systems, it said.

China halted imports of U.S. beef in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease was found in Washington state. The country is the world’s second-biggest beef buyer after rapid growth over the past decade created the world’s second-largest economy and an expanding middle class that can afford more protein in their diets. China is already the world’s biggest pork consumer.

The re-opening of China to U.S. beef may provide new opportunities for packers including Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. meat processor, and Cargill Inc., the largest U.S. ground beef maker. Cargill didn’t immediately responded to an e-mail requesting comment.

“We applaud the efforts of USDA that have led China’s Ministry of Agriculture to lift its ban on U.S. beef,” Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson said in an e-mailed statement. “This is a positive step forward and we hope that the two governments can negotiate a strong access agreement for this important market in the near future.”

Rising Imports

China increased imports of beef by 51 percent in the first seven months of 2016 compared with last year because of slower domestic production caused by thin margins for Chinese cattle producers and the availability of cheap imports, Rabobank International said in a report. Beef and veal imports will jump 24 percent this year to 825,000 metric tons, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. That’s twice the purchases in 2013.

China’s consumption will increase 3.4 percent to 7.59 million tons, exceeding production of 6.79 million tons, the data show.

Surging demand had been a boon to Australian producers after a drought increased cattle slaughter and supply available for export. The country has recently been losing market share to Brazil, which was allowed to resume shipments to China last year.

Philip Seng, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Meat Export Federation said in a statement Thursday that China still has to negotiate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture about conditions that will apply to U.S. beef exports entering the market.

USMEF is waiting for “details about the remaining steps necessary for the market to officially open and for U.S. suppliers to begin shipping product,” Seng said in the statement.

Ramgarh (Jharkhand): On the same day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that killings in the name of cow protection won't be tolerated, a man was beaten to death by a mob here on Thursday on suspicion that he was carrying beef in his vehicle.

A case has been registered on the basis of a video footage of the lynching, police said.

The incident took place just a couple of days after a mob attacked and injured a man in Giridih district on suspicion that he had slaughtered a cow.

SP Kishore Kaushal told a press conference that around 30 people had surrounded the van bearing a West Bengal number plate in the Bazaar Tand area of Ramgarh police station.

They dragged out the driver of the vehicle, Mohd Allimuddin, a resident of neighbouring Hazaribagh district, and thrashed him, injuring him seriously.

The police on getting information rushed to the spot and took Allimuddin to a hospital where he was declared "brought dead" by doctors, a police officer said.

The mob also set the vehicle on fire, he said.

According to Kaushal, the case was registered on the basis of the video footage and asserted the guilty would be arrested soon.

Ramgarh Deputy Commissioner Rajeswari B, who was also present in the press conference, said additional forces have been deployed in the area to maintain law and order.

Banning cow slaughter has become a major political and social issue in India but a study published by US researchers suggests this may indeed help mitigate global warming. A team of researchers from four American universities report that “eating beans instead of beef would sharply reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG)” responsible for climate change.

The team, headed by Helen Harwatt of California’s Loma Linda University (LLU) concluded that “if Americans would eat beans instead of beef, the US would immediately realise approximately 50 to 75 per cent of its GHG reduction targets for the year 2020” without imposing any new standards on automobiles or manufacturing.

Shifting dietary patterns to achieve the required GHG reductions has long been advocated by researchers. But so far food consumption has not been anchored in climate change policy to the same extent as energy production and transportation. In a 10-page paper published in the journal Climatic Change, the researchers said they performed a relatively simple analysis to calculate the difference in GHGs resulting from the replacement of beef with beans in terms of both calories and protein.

“Our results demonstrate that substituting beans for beef could achieve approximately 46 to 74 per cent of the reductions needed to meet the 2020 GHG target for the US. In turn, this shift would free up 42 per cent of US cropland,” the report said.

It said that while not currently recognised as a climate policy option, “the beans for beef scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits, illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shift”.

The researchers explained that beef cattle are the most GHG-intensive food to produce and that the production of legumes (beans, peas et al) results in 1/40th the amount of GHGs as beef.

The researchers note that more than a third of American consumers are currently purchasing meat analogs — plant-based products that resemble animal foods in taste and texture, a trend suggesting that animal-sourced meat is no longer a necessity.

“Our findings demonstrate that substituting plant-sourced foods for animal-sourced foods can play an important role in climate change mitigation,” the researchers conclude.

“While substituting beans for beef does not entirely satisfy the US GHG reduction targets, it could be combined with mitigation efforts for other major emitters such as power generation or transportation,” the researchers said.

A murdered person was killed in Jharkhand just a few hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that killing people in the name of Beef Ban was not acceptable. Some people were attacked by a man accused of Beef Ban. His car was set on fire. The victim was seriously injured and died after being treated. The incident took place in Bajarand village in Ramgarh district. According to police. While a man named Alimuddin was in his car, some people blocked the village in the village. Alimuddin was hit from the car and hit hard. Accused him of moving the Beef Ban. As the police came to the courthouse, the thugs fled there. Alimuddin was seriously injured and he was taken to the hospital.



Police say that this is a premeditated murder. Alimuddin knew that he was coming along the road and the thugs were waiting there before. The incident has been investigated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Gujarat on the night of the attack on behalf of Goyad. It was not fair to take the law into their own hands. This happened only a few minutes after Modi said

Modi Speach to Beef Ban

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the killing of others in the name of Beef Ban is not acceptable. It is clear that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands. Prime Minister’s participation in the ceremony was held on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Sabarmati Ashram founded by Mahatma Gandhi.

Modi is a complete opposite of the anti-national ideals – the torture in the name of Bhagwat. ‘We can not do anything by portraying others in the covering of the cow, and by torturing others. Such events cause me pain and sadness. We have a tradition of providing food for ants, street dogs and fish.

This is where Mahatma Gandhi taught the non-violence theory. What’s the matter with us? ‘ The Prime Minister has questioned the issue. Modi said that he worshiped the goons more than Mahatma Gandhi and his follower Vinoba Bhave, and there was no one left for the conservation of them.

Suggesting a way to protect the cow and how to live the country. Mahatma will not be allowed to kill people in the name of Goos. “The Constitution of India also states about the protection of cows. Can we have the right to kill a person at last? Would it be like worshiping the cow? He asked questions. He said that no problem was solved by violence and there was no violence in society.

Beef Ban Killing Is not a trend

“If a patient dies and his relatives die in the hospital, then the hospital will be attacked. Some people die in a road accident, or some of them are injured when some vehicles are burned. In this manner, the law is taken into the hands of the massive violence, “he said. He called for working together to realize India’s dream of Mahatma Gandhi, and called for the freedom of the country to be proud of freedom fighters.

The Prime Minister explained about an incident involving his childhood. Vinobha Bhavan recollected killing the cows. He was all over the Sabarmati Ashram. The Prime Minister unveiled special editions and post covers printed on the occasion of the ashram anniversary.

This is Mahatma

He said the Sabarmati Ashram Mahapatne was own and the whole human light flickered from here. To this extent the visitor’s book – ‘Hriday Kunj’ is written in the Gujarati language. “The 100-year Sabarmati Ashram is not just a half-year-old building, not a single institution … a mindset of a racial structure.

Bapu made it a tap of the race from hundreds of years of slavery and made us self-reliant. This place is not only India but also the world humanity. I am heading to Tappu Bhoomi and so great Mahatma, “he said.

He talked to the monastery trustees and learned about the activities here. Plant a plant. Mahatma was paid homage to the idol. The yarn was rotated by the spinning wheel.
