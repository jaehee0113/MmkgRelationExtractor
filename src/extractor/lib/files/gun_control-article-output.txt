A Pennsylvania man was arrested on first-degree murder and other charges Sunday in the "savage" road-rage shooting of an 18-year-old woman last week, authorities said.

David Desper, 28, of Trainer, turned himself into authorities in Chester County outside Philadelphia, District Attorney Tom Hogan said. Desper and Bianca Roberson, who just graduated from high school, were trying to merge into a single lane Wednesday, Hogan said.

"They jockeyed for position, and he wasn't happy, so he pulled out a gun and shot Bianca in the head, killing her instantly," he said.

Roberson's car veered off the road and crashed into a tree while the shooter fled in a bright red pickup. Surveillance video and tips from the public helped identify the car, and authorities urged Desper to turn himself in.

Hours after he did, the truck was found with a semiautomatic handgun inside that police say was used in the shooting.

Desper is white and Roberson black, but Hogan declined to link the shooting to race.

"This appears to be a savage, senseless and brutal act from one human being to another human being," he said.

The assault rifle a deranged doctor used to blast his former co-workers at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital had been purchased less than two weeks earlier from an upstate gun store, police sources said Sunday.

The AM-15, carefully concealed under Henry Bello’s white lab coat as he entered the building Friday, was bought from Upstate Guns and Ammo in Schenectady on June 20 — just eight days before the rampage that left one doctor dead and six other people wounded.

The box for the gun was found in Bello’s apartment in the Bronx, sources said.

The owner of the store, Craig Serafini, declined to answer questions at his home in a Schenectady suburb.

Slain Bronx-Lebanon Hospital doctor was covering for a colleague

“Take a walk,” he said before shutting the door on a Daily News reporter.

Investigators believe Bello, 45, bought the gun himself, sources said.

The gun appeared to have been legally purchased despite Gov. Cuomo’s assault weapons ban, which he signed into law in Jan. 2013, following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The law instituted a stricter definition of assault weapons not allowed to be sold in the state, including the Bushmaster used in Newtown, Conn.

Hospital shooter yelled 'Why didn't you help me out' amid rampage

The gun control law, known as the SAFE ACT, was hailed as one of the toughest in the nation.

Yet the law didn’t keep the deadly assault-style rifle out of Bello’s hands— despite his several run-ins with the law.

On April 23, 2003, Bello was arrested for burglary after kicking in his girlfriend’s door and entering her Bronx apartment, a police source said. That case appeared to have been dismissed, a source said.

That year he was also busted for fare beating, which is a misdemeanor.

On Aug. 28, 2004, he was arrested in the East Village for grabbing a 23-year-old woman by the crotch, telling her, “You’re coming with me,” police sources said.

He pleaded guilty in September of that year to unlawful imprisonment — a misdemeanor — and was sentenced to community service.

He was arrested again in October 2009 for unlawful surveillance under a victim’s clothing, a source said. That case is sealed, indicating the charges were dismissed.

A Cuomo spokeswoman was unable to immediately clarify how the AM-15 avoided the assault rifle ban.

The SAFE Act banned certain rifles through a very technical definition of what constitutes an “assault rifle.”

According to the governor’s SAFE Act website, banned assault rifles are “semiautomatic rifles capable of receiving a detachable magazine” that also have one or more of an array of military characteristics, including a bayonet mount, protruding pistol grip, or a folding or telescopic stock.

Bello had dodged any felony convictions, which would have prevented him from purchasing a firearm in New York.

(New York Daily News)

Late on Sunday it emerged that the city’s background check on Bello before hiring him in September as a home aide for AIDS and HIV patients also didn’t uncover any red flags.

Meanwhile, the six surviving victims of the attack — five hospital staffers and one patient — remain in stable condition but none have been released from the hospital, a spokesman said Sunday.

Two of the victims were transferred to Mt. Sinai Hospital for specialized care and they remain in critical but stable condition, hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said.

The four other victims who survived the rampage are still receiving treatment at Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center.

“All are downgraded to stable condition,” Schneer said.

None of the victims were expected to be released Sunday, he said.

The woman slain by Bello, Dr. Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, ended up in the crosshairs because she was covering a shift for a colleague.

Tam was actually supposed to be off the day Bello attacked.

Bello’s target, Dr. Kamran Ahmed, was off of work the day of the attack. Ahmed said he had no idea why he was the object of Bello’s hatred.

Former employee opens fire at Bronx Lebanon Hospital

“The strange thing is he was nice with me,” Ahmed told the Daily News on Saturday.

“I’m shocked. He had a problem with everybody.”

Two hours prior to storming the hospital, Bello ranted in an email to The News that the hospital had unfairly derailed his career in medicine.

Sources have said he was forced to resign in Feb. 2015 after being accused of sexually harassing a worker.

“This hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine,” Bello wrote to The News at 12:46 p.m. on Friday.

“First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse.”

Police sources said he shouted at his former colleagues as he exacted revenge.

“Why didn’t you help me out when I was in trouble?” sources said he yelled.

Bello shot himself as police closed in.

A hero cop who took out a gunman single handedly is in line for a national bravery award.

Police constable Rob Shakespeare, 35, was on plain clothes duty when he gave chase after a masked robber threatened staff at Wing Lee, takeaway on Manchester Road, Heaton Chapel, Stockport, and stole £20.

After hearing on his radio that a balaclava-clad man had been seen in the area carrying a gun he spotted the man threatening the staff in the takeaway.

The crook then took off on his pedal bike.

Knowing armed response vehicles were still some way off Pc Shakespeare followed him alone.

But the gunman doubled back and rode towards him.

Realising the man was a danger in a busy shopping area the unarmed officer made a split second decision to take him on.

As the robber cycled past him, Pc Shakespeare clipped the wheel of the bike, knocking him to the floor, where he lost grip of the firearm.

The man grabbed the gun and ran back towards the high street. Pc Shakespeare gave chase on foot shouting “Police, stop and drop the weapon”. He then tackled him to the ground and took hold of the gun.

Pc Shakespeare - along with help from members of the public - managed to detain the man.

He will attend a reception and an evening awards ceremony in London in July.

The National Police Bravery Awards honour officers who have performed outstanding acts of bravery while on or off duty.

Ian Hanson, Chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, said: “Not many people could claim to have tackled an armed offender, and to do so unarmed and with no back up, just goes to show how truly courageous and committed police officer Pc Shakespeare is.

“His thoughts were not for his own safety but for the people of Stockport that day and we are all beyond proud of him for his brave actions. He represents the very best of the best and we salute him. Well done Pc Shakespeare.”

Pc Shakespeare, an officer at Cheadle Heath station, said: “He had made threats to the public with what was believed to have been a firearm so I made the decision to intervene.”

“It was a momentary decision, the concern was he had the potential to cause harm - I thought I would have one opportunity to detain him before it went too far.

“I felt confident I would be quick enough to grab hold of him before he could discharge (the gun). I didn’t have time to worry, I’ve done the job a long time so am confident of dealing with a range of hostility.”
This week, USC had a public shooting. I’d actually been tweeting with one of the students in the school as it occurred. As quickly as you can say “wait for the facts,” leftists have already begun the gun-control talks. As per usual, they trot out their usual misconceptions and outright factual inaccuracies. Here are five of them.

1. Gun free zones keep people safe. Not true. 92% of public shootings since 2009 have occurred inside gun free zones. It’s a pretty easy stat to find. Yet for some reason, leftists just… try to completely ignore it.

2. They’re committed largely by assault rifles. Not even close. 80% of murders involving a firearm are committed by handguns.

3. Cities and countries with strict gun laws have lower instances of shootings. Chicago, a historically gun-free city, saw 82 shootings on July 4th weekend last year, and regularly ranks in the top 3 highest murder rate cities in America. But, when the city began issuing concealed carry permits, the city experienced its lowest murder rate since 1958!



4. Gun violence is increasing. Factually, gun violence in the United States is much lower than it was 20 years ago. Statistically speaking, school shootings are extremely rare. Children are actually 100 times more likely to be shot outside a school than in one, and more mass shootings happen at restaurants than at schools.

5. Violent video games lead to mass killings. This is a myth. While many video games are graphically violent, scientists have not been able to find any causal links between video games and mass murder. So instead of trotting out this old lie overtime there’s a tragedy…
version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"? Synopsis When it comes to the gun control debate, there are two kinds of data: data that's accurate, and data that left-wing billionaires and politicians want you to believe is accurate. In Lying to Steal Your Guns , economist and gun rights advocate John Lott turns a skeptical eye to the recent explosion of well-funded anti-gun studies that perpetuate false statistics to frighten Americans into giving up their guns.

Reviews Reviews "Amidst threats of terrorism, the need for John Lott's The War on Guns and a rational debate on guns has never been greater. Paris and San Bernardino show us that gun-free zones won't stop terrorists. As this book documents, these killers consciously pick targets where they know victims will be sitting ducks. Lott carefully proves that the push for more gun control only makes the types of attacks that we fear more likely to occur. Next time you drop your child off at school, try and find the sign saying, 'Gun Free Zone.' Stop for a moment and ask yourself, 'Does this really keep my child safe?' If you still have questions, read The War on Guns ." --Newt Gingrich, "The Second Amendment has no better defender than John Lott. What makes him so invaluable is his ability to go beyond philosophical arguments and to engage opponents of gun ownership on the facts. Through rigorous research and analysis of data, he has been able to show in previous books that increased gun possession can actually make people safer and reduce crime. In The War on Guns , his latest contribution to the gun debate, he takes aim at a wide range of anti-gun shibboleths and exposes the fraudulence of each one. For that, he has done his country and the cause of gun rights a great service. For anyone looking to be armed with the truth about guns, I highly recommend that you add this book to your arsenal." --TED CRUZ, U.S. senator, Texas "Amidst threats of terrorism, the need for John Lott''s The War on Guns and a rational debate on guns has never been greater.

Do mass shootings occur more in the U.S. than other developed countries? No. Did Australia''s gun laws make them safer? Hardly. Will background checks on private transfers of guns make us safer? No. He destroys one myth after another. John Lott is a national treasure." --MARK LEVIN, constitutional lawyer, New York Times bestselling author, and host of the nationally syndicated radio show, The Mark Levin Show "The war on guns will never end because the anti-gun zealots will never raise the white flag even though the research and data in this book has soundly defeated them. The key is to continue to beat back their propaganda, misinformation, manipulation of data, and even outright lies, in order to protect our God-given right to keep and bear arms." --SHERIFF DAVID A. CLARKE JR., sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin "John Lott is the most dogged, intellectually credible, academic defender of the right to keep and bear arms in the United States today. He is also the chief beast in the night to the gun control crowd. His works are must reading for those of us on the front lines in these debates. The War on Guns is his best work yet. In it, the reader will find well-documented all the data, statistics, practical, legal, and moral arguments one will ever need to support the natural right to self-defense. The statists will fear this book. Freedom lovers will crave it." --HON. ANDREW P. NAPOLITANO, senior judicial analyst Fox News Channel, and Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School "To paraphrase a once-famous commercial slogan, ''When John R. Lott speaks, everyone listens.'' Or, at least they should when this leading expert on all matters gun control speaks out so provocatively and persuasively. In his new book, Lott delves into the myriad ways in which anti-gun ''statistics'' and ''research'' have been used to perpetrate utter falsehoods and misleading propaganda. If there is to be any intelligent, honest, and objective discussion of gun policy in the United States, then The War on Guns ought to be required reading." --CHARLES J. GOETZ, Joseph M. Hartfield Professor of Law Emeritus, University of Virginia School of Law "John R. Lott is a role model for those who do scientific research on important problems. He is objective and logical.

FOLSOM -- While moving out of his Orangevale home, a man claims three movers took around $12,000 in belongings and guns.

Many of Mike Brown's firearms as well as his wife's jewelry were taken from inside a bedroom closet.

"Knew we had valuables in there so the doors were shut, things were pushed back up in corners of the closet, covered up," Brown said.

Originally, Brown said he made it clear to the movers that they would only need to load up what he told them to. Soon after they started, the three men began to act strangely.

"They kept distracting us the entire time, in one way or another," Brown said. "And, like, one of the three guys would disappear at certain times."

After they dropped off the furniture at his new place, Brown said goodbye to the movers. When he got back to the old house, he quickly noticed his handgun was missing.

That's when he called the moving company, Folsom Relocation and Storage. Whoever answered the phone didn't react the way Brown thought they should have.

"'Uh, you know there's nothing we can do. We can't help you, you'll just have to file a police report,'" Brown recalled the person on the other end saying. "I said, 'No, these are your employees. You brought them to my house, and you refuse to do anything about it?'"

"'There's nothing we can do,'" the person continued.

"I mean, they didn't have the time of day for me," Brown said.

FOX40 was able to track down the owner of the company, who said he will be performing an internal investigation into the allegations and has suspended the movers involved.

Brown said he wishes he had done a quick company search online, because later he turned up several bad reviews with similar theft claims against it.

In the meantime, Brown has filed a police report. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department confirms it is investigating the case. When using professional moving companies, the department recommends asking for photocopies of each mover's ID before allowing them into your home.

CNN and others are claiming that the silly video President Trump posted earlier today “encourages violence against reporters.”

So, if a video using a clip from a staged bit at a WWE event is an incitement to violence, how should we treat then candidate Barack Obama in 2008 telling Dems this? From FactCheck.org:

The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., published the entire pool report, which included the quote now attributed to Obama. Chozick, June 13, 2008: He [Obama] warned that the general election campaign could get ugly. “They’re going to try to scare people. They’re going to try to say that ‘that Obama is a scary guy,’ ” he said. A donor yelled out a deep accented “Don’t give in!” “I won’t but that sounded pretty scary. You’re a tough guy,” Obama said. “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,” Obama said. “Because from what I understand folks in Philly like a good brawl. I’ve seen Eagles fans.”

Then, a call for a “good brawl,” perhaps with guns, was just a metaphor. But now it’s not?

More Guns, More Crime

A new analysis of 40 years of data adds powerful new evidence undermining the oft-repeated claim that more guns lead to less crime.

Examining four decades of crime data, a team of Stanford researchers found that states that have enacted so-called ‘right to carry’ (RTC) concealed handgun laws experience higher rates of violent crime than states where these laws have not been adopted. The findings are among the most powerful evidence in a growing line of research refuting the claim that arming more citizens enhances public safety.

“There is not even the slightest hint in the data that RTC laws reduce overall violent crime,” Stanford Law Professor John Donohue and colleagues concluded in the new study.

RTC laws, also known as ‘shall issue’ laws, lower the bar to qualify for a concealed carry license by requiring states to issue concealed-carry permits to anyone who meets basic criteria for gun ownership. As a result, states that adopt RTC laws grant concealed carry permits at higher rates than states where more discretion is used (“may issue” states) and thus have greater numbers of armed citizens.

If, as groups like the National Rifle Association argue, higher rates of gun ownership really do reduce crime, we would expect to see lower crime rates in states with RTC laws, where more residents carry guns. But that’s not what the evidence shows. In fact, as this latest study found, the evidence suggests that just the opposite is true.

“We estimate that the adoption of RTC laws substantially elevates violent crime rates,” the Stanford researchers concluded in a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. “Ten years after the adoption of RTC laws, violent crime [in RTC states] is estimated to be 13–15 percent higher than it would have been without the RTC law.”

The analysis builds on a 2004 NBER report, which debunked claims that RTC laws were associated with less crime, but was not able to definitively conclude that concealed carry rates influenced violent crime rates — in either direction. At the time, researchers were limited by uncertainty in the estimates produced by the best available data and statistical models.

“The committee found that answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods, however well designed,” the 2004 report stated.

Synthetic States

To overcome the limitations in the initial report, the Stanford researchers used a new statistical method that estimates what crime rates would have looked like in RTC states had they not adopted RTC laws, accounting for differences across other explanatory variables such as demographic changes, economic factors, and policing practices.

To do this, the team built artificial, or “synthetic,” states to serve as near-identical counterparts to the 33 states that passed RTC laws between 1981 and 2014. Using state-level crime rates prior to the laws’ adoption, as well as national crime data from before and after, the researchers created an algorithm to predict what crime trends would have looked like had these areas never passed RTC laws. Then, they compared crime rates in the actual states with findings from the model using the synthetic control states, repeating the analysis for all 33 RTC states.

The results were strikingly consistent: After applying the synthetic control approach to four previously published statistical data models, the researchers found that in all four cases, RTC states experienced a 13–15 percent increase in violent crime rates within 10 years of the law’s passage.

“All this work is based on statistical models,” Donohue said. “When the models all generate similar estimates, it increases your confidence that you have captured the true effect.”

The study also found that although nationwide violent crime rates have fallen as right-to-carry laws have proliferated, the drop was not evenly distributed: In those states that didn’t adopt RTC laws, the decrease in violent crime was four times greater than in states that did enact these laws.

While violent crime rates fell nationwide as many states adopted right-to-carry (RTC) laws, the drop was four times greater in states that did not enact RTC — another piece of evidence showing that more people carrying guns does not deter violent crime.

These findings are particularly notable given that RTC states were found to have increased rates of incarceration and hiring of law enforcement personnel — factors that would usually be associated with less violent crime, not more.

“This suggested that RTC states were not simply experiencing higher crime because they decided to lock up fewer criminals and hire fewer police,” Donohue said. “The relatively greater increases in incarceration and police in RTC states implies that, if anything, our synthetic controls estimates may be understating the increase in violent crime, which was pretty persuasive to me.”

This study is consistent with other recent analyses examining the relationship between gun laws and violent crime rates. In one of most comprehensive studies in the field, researchers determined that gun ownership is the main factor driving gun violence trends in the United States. “For each percentage point increase in gun ownership the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9 percent,” the study concluded. This relationship has also been documented on a global scale, with a country’s gun ownership rate emerging as a strong and independent predictor of their firearm homicide rate.

Concealed Carry: Weighing the Risks

Donohue acknowledges that under certain circumstances, carrying a gun may confer benefits. For example, many people carry guns for self-defense purposes; with sufficient training, successful defensive firearm uses do occur. However, the overall harm far outweighs the benefits, Donohue said, pointing to a 2013 report that found no evidence of any defensive gun uses in over 99 percent of violent crimes in the U.S. — despite the record number of firearms in circulation in the U.S. today (nearly 300 million).

Donohue’s claim is supported by an expansive body of research showing that guns are far more likely to be used to injure, kill, or threaten than to be used in self-defense. Furthermore, many reported self-defense gun uses are actually aggressive rather than protective in nature. For example, in a pair of nationwide surveys assessing incidents of gun victimization and defensive gun uses, many people reported using guns in situations that did not involve a physical threat in the first place — including verbal altercations, unarmed trespassing, and even minor annoyances like being interrupted while watching a movie. “Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense,” the study authors concluded. “Most self reported self defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society.”

For the vast majority of Americans, Donohue said, carrying a gun to avoid becoming a crime victim is akin to thinking that having a weekly brain scan will save your life, without considering the potential hazardous effects of radiation exposure.

“If we gave 300 million people a brain scan, we would save a certain number of lives,” Donohue said. “But you wouldn’t want to advocate that treatment without considering how many lives would be lost by exposing so many to radiation damage. One needs to consider both the costs and benefits of any treatment or policy. If the net effect of more gun carrying is that violent crime is elevated, then RTC laws seem much less appealing.”
The NRA is under fire like never before; targeted by leftists in political office and the establishment media alike. Yet instead of cowering, the civil rights organization is making clear they have no intention of changing course or apologizing for “telling the truth.”

The current onslaught against the NRA stems from a commercial in which the organization describes the left’s used of figurative, linguistic, and actual violence against those with whom they disagree.

The commercial, which was released just over two weeks after a Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire on GOP Congressional members in Alexandria, is narrated by the NRA’s Dana Loesch. She says:

They use their media to assassinate real news, they use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and awards shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the ‘resistance,’ all to make them march; to make them protest and scream ‘racism’ and ‘xenophobia’ and ‘homophobia’ [and] to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, [and] bully and terrorize the law-abiding.

The left went apoplectic in response to the commercial and took to Twitter to suggest the NRA’s commercial bordered on an outright threat. Some on the left even claimed being fearful because of the NRA’s commercial.

For example, Vice News tweeted about “the NRA’s threatening video” and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) tweeted:

Watching this @NRA video sent a chill down my spine–followed by a feeling of sadness & fear that I haven’t shaken… https://t.co/O0hUab6b41 pic.twitter.com/ZYOMxCAJmv — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) June 30, 2017

In response to the left’s hand-wringing, the NRA doubled down and released a video in which NRATV’s Grant Stinchield tells leftists to “get over [themselves].”

A Sedalia man says he shot and killed his son after mistaking him for an intruder.

He told Douglas County sheriff's deputies that he thought someone was breaking into his home late Saturday night and fired his weapon.

"RP [reporting party] saying he shot someone who came into his house. Said it's his son and he's now saying he's dead."-Sheriff's office dispatch tape

The homeowner told 911 he believed his son was "beyond help." According to dispatch tapes, the victim may have been shot six times, though this detail has not yet been confirmed by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.

The coroner's office identified the victim Monday as 33-year-old Nicholas Hunter. They also confirmed his cause of death from from a gunshot wound.

The shooting happened around 10:15 p.m. at a home on Elk Canyon Court, which is off of Highway 105 a couple miles south of Sedalia. The homeowner is currently facing second-degree murder charges, but that could change based on the findings of the investigation, according to the sheriff's office.

Drugs and alcohol are currently not suspected factors.

DOUGLAS COUNTY, Colo. -- A Sedalia man who called 911 on Saturday night said he had shot an intruder.

Moments later, the man said the man he had shot was his adult son, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said Sunday.

Frank Leo Huner Jr. called police at about 10:15 p.m. to say he'd shot a person at his home near Elk Canyon Circle and Elk Canyon Court, according to the sheriff's office.

The person who was shot was later pronounced dead, investigators said. The Douglas County Coroner's Office will formally identify the body to confirm whether it is Huner's son.

Huner, 59, was booked on a charge of second-degree murder, but sheriff's officials said that could change as they continue to investigate.

WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania man was in custody Sunday for what a prosecutor called the "savage" and "senseless" death of a recent high school graduate shot in the head during a road-rage confrontation as the two tried to merge in a single lane.

David Desper, 28, of Trainer, turned himself in accompanied by an attorney early Sunday, and police said he was charged with first- and third-degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and reckless endangering in the death of 18-year-old Bianca Roberson in West Goshen Township.

Desper and Roberson, who had just graduated from Bayard Rustin High School in West Chester and was planning to attend Jacksonville University in Florida this fall, were trying to merge into a single lane Wednesday as a two-lane road narrowed, Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan said.

"They jockeyed for position, and he wasn't happy, so he pulled out a gun and shot Bianca in the head, killing her instantly," he said.

After Roberson was shot, her car veered off the road, struck a tree and was found in a ditch. The shooter fled in a red pickup, driving partly along the shoulder of the highway until exiting the road. Authorities tracked the suspect vehicle on surveillance video and sorted through hundreds of tips from the public, calling on the suspect to turn himself in for his own sake and for the sake of the family.

"We got a crucial piece of evidence from Bianca herself, because the round recovered from her was reviewed by a forensic ballistics expert who told us that that round came from a 40-caliber Smith and Wesson semi-automatic handgun," Hogan said.

Desper had a permit to carry the gun, which he purchased in November 2015, Hogan said.

After Desper turned himself in, the dented red pickup truck sought in the shooting was found in nearby Glen Mills, and the 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun police believed was used was found in the suspect's bedroom, Hogan said.

Asked if race was a factor in the slaying — Desper is white and Roberson black — Hogan said there was no indication that race played a role. "This appears to be a savage, senseless and brutal act from one human being to another human being," he said.

Desper remained in custody without bail. Defense attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined comment Sunday.

A possible domestic dispute ended in a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Saturday morning on the Northeast Side.

Bexar County Sheriff's Office responded to the 7200 block of Glen Bay for a "shooting in progress" about 3:30 a.m., according to a news release.

Deputies discovered an unresponsive unknown adult male on the floor of a residence with gun shot wounds when they arrived, BSCO reports.

According to deputies at the scene the man was the ex-boyfriend of a woman living at the residence. He allegedly forced his way into the residence and attacked the woman.

A third person, a male, then shot the suspect to stop the assault, according to the news release.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE/CNN) – A New Mexico homeowner caught a burglar breaking into his home and, with the help of a neighbor, restrained the suspect with duct tape until police arrived.

Albuquerque Police said surveillance video captured Mark Thompson breaking into the home, and then getting a little too comfortable inside the residence.

In the security video, Thompson is seen casually walking around the house Sunday afternoon, putting on a jacket, and even turning on the TV.

At one point, he grabs a beer from the fridge. The homeowner got an alert that there was movement in his home. He watched Thompson on his phone and called his neighbor.

Shandra Vestal lives across the street from that homeowner and didn’t hesitate to help.

“I went to my garage, my husband and I. We got two pistols. We met him at the cul-de-sac. He blocked off the entry of the cul-de-sac to make sure if he did have a vehicle, the man entering the home wouldn’t be able to escape,” she said. “As he pulled in, I passed him this 45 and then I got the other Ruger.”

That’s when the woman, her husband, and the homeowner confronted Thompson.

“Micah and I went into the home with two of the loaded weapons. Micah announced himself to the perpetrator saying, ‘I have a loaded weapon, get down on your hands and knees,'” she said. “At that time, I came up behind him and we got the individual on his hands and knees to lay down.”

At that point, they made sure he had no way of escaping.

“We got his arms and his feet duct taped. Then we picked him up, carried him out to the front yard and waited for the police to show up,” said Vestal.

When police showed up, they found Thompson on the ground, his hands and ankles taped.

“The police had told us that the home prior that he had broken into. He was wearing the same clothes he had stolen from that home when he broke into Micah’s house,” Vestal said.

This time, Thompson tried to talk his way out of trouble.

“He truly said, ‘I’m not trying to steal anything, I just want to be friends,'” she said.

The homeowner and neighbor said they were both confident in their ability to detain the suspect, because they had both served in the army.

A burglary suspect was arrested Tuesday after being shot at by a homeowner and a pursuit through Knox County, according to the Knox County Sheriff's Office.

Brandon Wang, 26, is accused of breaking into the home of William Brooks on Wayland Road just before 5 a.m. Tuesday.

Brooks told deputies he found Wang in his hallway and fired multiple shots at him, resulting in Wang running out of the house to his truck.

KCSO said with Brooks firing at him, Wang ran his truck through the garage door, causing major damage before being spotted by patrol officers on Flint Gap Road.

A KCSO officer attempted a traffic stop, but Wang allegedly sped away.

Officers chased Wang to Thorngrove Pike, John Sevier Highway, and then to what turned out to be the suspect’s address, on Strawberry Plains Pike.

KCSO told Local 8 News the suspect drove around his home, spun around and hit a deputy's car head-on.

Deputies tased Wang while he struggled with officers trying to remove him from his vehicle.

KCSO said officers found what is believed to be 14.3 grams of marijuana in Wang's truck.

Wang was evaluated by Rural Metro and taken to the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility. He is being held on a $10,000 bond and is charged with simple possession, evading arrest, vandalism, and aggravated burglary. He does not have a criminal history in Knox County.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Chinese food delivery driver shot at least one of three teens who police said set up the driver with the intent to rob him.

Police said a group of three teens called in a Hot Wok Chinese order and had it delivered to a vacant home on Arancio Drive on the Westside.

The delivery driver showed up to the home and was held at gunpoint, according to police.

Neighbors told News4Jax that the driver threw the food at one of the teens and pulled his own gun, a Glock, from its holster. He fired four to five shots and hit at least one of the teens, according to police.

"Is that money really worth it? The man says he had $200 at the most on him," said one neighbor, Kelsey who did not give her last name. "Y'all planned to kill somebody over $200? They don't think about innocent kids next door and the next family. When you have a weapon in your hand, anything can happen."

Anything including shots being fired at the robbers. That's exactly what Kelsey says the delivery man in this situation did when he realized his food delivery was an attempted robbery.

The bag of food and receipt were still left behind Wednesday. Crime scene tape is also on the ground where neighbors saw the whole thing unfold.

"He said he threw the Chinese food at the guy that ran up behind him and he said that he fired his shot," Kelsey said. "He specifically said that [he] didn't even get my second hand up to hold the gun."

Neighbors recorded video of the robber who was shot being taken to the hospital. Police say the other two ran away. Neighbors believe the crime was planned. The For Sale sign at the home is missing, and police say the robbers pointed a gun with a laser at the man and repeatedly told him to get inside.

All of which Kelsey says could've turned out worse for the neighborhood.

"Any money, you don't care, you don't have the right to even think about taking somebody's life or think about harming them over some money," Kelsey said.

Police say two of the robbers have been arrested and one is still at large. No names are being released pending investigation.

Around midnight on June 25th, Krystal Kasprytzki and her husband were in their home, when the door swung open. They called out for who they thought was her father, but no one answered.

When they walked toward the entrance to the home, they noticed an unknown man walking into the house.

Krystal was able to grab her gun and stop the man, and take him outside. They called 911 and police were able to respond quickly.

Krystal tells 40/29 News they normally keep one bullet in the gun, but her husband told her after the incident it was completely empty.

The man was arrested after the incident, but his name has not been released.


A Pennsylvania man was in custody Sunday for what a prosecutor called the "savage" and "senseless" death of a recent high school graduate shot in the head during a road-rage confrontation as the two tried to merge in a single lane.

David Desper, 28, of Trainer, turned himself in accompanied by an attorney early Sunday, and police said he was charged with first- and third-degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and reckless endangering in the death of 18-year-old Bianca Roberson in West Goshen Township.

Desper and Roberson, who had just graduated from Bayard Rustin High School in West Chester and was planning to attend Jacksonville University in Florida this fall, were trying to merge into a single lane Wednesday as a two-lane road narrowed, Chester County Dist. Atty. Thomas Hogan said.

"They jockeyed for position, and he wasn't happy, so he pulled out a gun and shot Bianca in the head, killing her instantly," he said.

After Roberson was shot, her car veered off the road, struck a tree and was found in a ditch. The shooter fled in a red pickup, driving partly along the shoulder of the highway until exiting the road. Authorities tracked the suspect vehicle on surveillance video and sorted through hundreds of tips from the public, calling on the suspect to turn himself in for his own sake and for the sake of the family.

"We got a crucial piece of evidence from Bianca herself, because the round recovered from her was reviewed by a forensic ballistics expert who told us that that round came from a 40-caliber Smith and Wesson semi-automatic handgun," Hogan said.

Desper had a permit to carry the gun, which he purchased in November 2015, Hogan said.

Asked if race was a factor in the slaying — Desper is white and Roberson black — Hogan said there was no indication that race played a role. "This appears to be a savage, senseless and brutal act from one human being to another human being," he said.

Desper remained in custody without bail. Defense attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined comment Sunday.

A woman walking her dog in Sapulpa fired shots when she said a loose dog attacked her and her pet, according to police. The woman was in a neighborhood in the 1400 block of North Main when she told police a dog escaped its fence and went after her dog around 2 p.m. Tuesday, June 27.

The dogs started fighting, and the woman fired shots, an officer told News On 6. The woman told police she was bitten in the process.

Police said the loose dog was not wounded, but it was picked up by animal control. The woman, who has a concealed carry permit, was taken to the hospital by her husband, the officer said.

Authorities are searching for the man who attempted to rob a Brooklyn gun shop Wednesday morning, only to get shot by the shop owner.

The suspect was believed to be hit, as he left a trail of blood behind, but police have, thus far, been unable to locate him.

The would-be robbery unfolded at DF Brothers Sports Center in New York City’s Bensonhurst neighborhood. The suspect entered the shop just before 11 a.m. and asked to look at a gun for purchase.

But when the owner asked to see the man’s license, the suspect pulled out a can of pepper spray instead and blasted the owner in the face. The suspect then used a hammer to smash the display case and grabbed two guns.

The owner, however, was armed with a gun and opened fire on the suspect, causing him to drop the weapons and run off empty-handed.

When police arrived on the scene, they discovered a trail of blood, but the suspect was long gone. The owner, who did not wish to speak with reporters or have cameras inside his shop, is said to be okay, according to acquaintances who spoke with local media.

A rapper who was performing at the Arkansas nightclub where 25 people were shot has been arrested on unrelated charges, US police say.

Gunfire was exchanged during a concert at the Power Ultra Lounge nightclub in Little Rock early on Saturday.

Ricky Hampton, known by his stage name Finese 2 Tymes, was detained by police early on Sunday.

Little Rock Police tweeted that the arrest was on outstanding warrants and is unrelated to the shooting.

A total of 28 people were injured, including three in a stampede. The youngest victim was said to be 16.

Two people were in a serious condition, but officials said all were expected to survive.

The mayor of Little Rock, Mark Stodola, said the shooting was the result of a disagreement involving a number of patrons at the club, which quickly escalated because of "the presence of rivalries and weapons".

"I want to reassure our public that this was not an act of terrorism, but a tragedy... It does not appear to be a planned shooting," Mr Stodola told reporters.

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Mr Hampton's poster for the event was criticised in the aftermath of the shooting

Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said the authorities were investigating whether a longstanding rivalry between gangs was to blame for the shooting.

In a post on Facebook, Mr Hampton offered condolences to the injured who came to see him perform, saying "violence is not for the club."

"We all come with one motive at the end of the day, and that's to have fun. Not to be hurt," he said.

The KATV network quoted Mr Hampton's booking agent as saying the rapper had "nothing to do" with the shooting.

Image copyright Facebook

Promotional material for Mr Hampton's concert was criticised by Mayor Stodola and others on social media for its image of the rapper holding an assault rifle pointed at the camera.

The city of Little Rock has suspended the Power Ultra Lounge's licence, and officials say they plan to shut down the club permanently. The venue's landlord has also posted an eviction notice at the site, reports said.

Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson thanked the first responders to the scene - but also expressed concern about violence in the city.

"Little Rock's crime problem appears to be intensifying. Every few days it seems a high-profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning's event," he said.

He said a new strategy and extra resources were needed to "take the violent threats off the streets".

A previous version of this article quoted US media reports that inaccurately said Mr Hampton had been arrested in connection with the shooting.

One of the victims injured in a shooting at Bronx Lebanon Hospital in New York City is a Canadian, CTV News has learned.

Dr. Justin Timperio, 29, from St. Catharines, Ont., was shot Friday at the Bronx hospital along with six others when an ex-doctor, Henry Bello, went on a rampage.

Timperio was shot twice and sustained liver and kidney damage, his father, Luciano Timperio, told CTV News. He was sedated on Saturday night and has not been awake since the shooting.

Doctors won’t bring Timperio out of sedation until after his surgery on Monday, Timperio’s father said.

Timperio’s father also told The Canadian Press that his son graduated from Brock University and the American University of the Caribbean. He started working at Bronx-Lebanon about three years ago, for the clinical component of his medical training. He was then accepted to the hospital's family residency medical program, his father said.

One doctor, Dr. Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, was killed while covering a shift for another doctor. One patient, two medical students and three doctors, including Timperio, were injured in the shooting.

Bello died of a self-inflicted gunshot, police said.

Google announced plans on Friday to donate $2 million to a violence reduction campaign that includes the nation’s leading gun control organizations.

The grant will be given by Google.org, an arm of the search giant that provides money and resources to nonprofit organizations, and go to the PICO LIVE FREE Campaign. That campaign focuses on reducing gun violence, especially in minority communities centered in major cities. The new initiative it’s creating with the grant will involve gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Americans for Responsible Solutions, Guns Down America, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Alliance for Gun Responsibility.

The money will primarily be spent to “scale up and accelerate the implementation of evidence-based gun violence prevention strategies in cities with high incidents of gun related homicides and shootings” a press release detailing the grant said. Chicago, New York City, Dallas, Oakland, Orlando, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee will be among the cities the campaign focuses on. The campaign said its main goal will be to “support local efforts to reduce homicides by firearms, decrease mass incarceration, and center communities of color in the fight to reduce gun violence in America.”

A man from Delaware County, Pa. has been charged with the road rage shooting that left a recent high school graduate dead.He is identified as 28-year-old David Desper from Trainer, Pa.Desper is charged with first and third degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and reckless endangering in Wednesday's death of 18-year-old Bianca Roberson in West Goshen Township.District Attorney Tom Hogan said at a news conference on Sunday morning that Desper surrendered around 2 a.m.Desper's red pickup truck, which was seen on surveillance video, was located in Glen Mills. Only Action News was there at West Goshen Township police headquarters when the truck was hauled in.Detectives also recovered the 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun they believe was used to shoot Roberson in the head. It was found in Desper's bedroom, authorities say.Hogan said Desper has a permit to carry the weapon.The shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday where Route 100 and Route 202 merge in West Goshen Twp., Chester County. Desper and Roberson were trying to merge into the same lane."This is the story of a savage and senseless murder. Someone didn't want her to merge into a lane of traffic," Hogan said.Highway cameras reveal Roberson and the pickup driver had some sort of altercation minutes before the shooting."As Bianca was merging from two lanes to one, there was a man in a red pick up truck also merging down and they jockeyed for position and he wasn't happy," Hogan said. "So he pulled out a gun and shot Bianca in the head, killing her instantly."Cameras showed the driver of the red pickup, identified as Desper, fleeing toward Paoli Pike."They were jostling for a position or whatever. And unfortunately this gentleman took it to a degree that was just unconscionable," said West Goshen Police Chief Joe Gleason in a news conference earlier this week.After the shooting, Roberson's car went off the highway and struck a tree.Multiple photos and videos of the red pickup truck were released to the media in the days since the shooting. Authorities say those images led to numerous tips from the public.Hogan said that there was no indication that race was a factor in the slaying."This appears to be a savage, senseless and brutal act from one human being to another human being," he said.Roberson was a recent graduate of Bayard Rustin High School in West Chester and was set to attend Jacksonville University in the fall. Her brother told Action News she was "headed for greatness."This is just the latest tragedy for Roberson's family. Four years ago, they lost Bianca's older brother.Family members say when Wednesday's crash happened, Roberson had just left an area mall. She was shopping for college clothes with her mother and grandmother."I hope it's not Bianca." That's what the teen's grandmother said to herself as she passed the crash site Wednesday, intending to meet up with her granddaughter at home.She had no idea the traffic backup she was sitting in was caused by the crash involving her granddaughter."Not one bit," added Aunt Mari Hatton-Hayes. "And then when she saw the police she said she had this crazy feeling."Police were already at the house to notify Roberson's family that she had died at the scene."She's so young. And to go through something like that by herself.... She had to have been pretty scared," said Dontae Alburg, Bianca's brother.The community is responding to the death of the college bound teen, as dozens came to a vigil in her honor Friday. On Saturday, members of a local brewing company who have never met Bianca felt compelled to help.They collected donations and were donating proceeds from their best selling beer for Bianca's family.Joel Sprick of Levante Brewing Company of West Goshen Township said, "We wanted to give back to the community and show our support.
Back in March, a lawsuit against Remington was resurrected by Joshua Koskoff, the lawyer for the Sandy Hook victims’ families. The lawsuit aims to hold Remington, the parent company of Bushmaster, responsible for the tragic shooting that occurred in December 2012.

A number of gun rights groups have filed Amicus Curiae Briefs, which literally translates to “friend of the court,” on behalf of Remington. The groups include the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, Gun Owners of America, the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

According to Gun Owners of America, the plantiffs’ brief is similar to a novel:

It is chock full of fanciful and grandiose language, describing the AR-15 style firearms at issue in this case as if they were weapons the likes of which the universe has never seen.1 However, like many novels, these descriptions, while colorful, have little if any basis in reality. Plaintiffs’ brief illustrates the views of those who may never have even laid eyes on the weapons they vilify — much less squeezed off a few rounds at the range, like millions of peaceful, law-abiding Americans regularly do.

The NSSF, which is based in Newton, Connecticut, says this decision could have a negative impact on the hunting and shooting sport industry:

“These lawsuits have most typically assigned blame to firearm industry members for damages caused when criminals misuse lawfully sold, nondefective firearms,” the request says. “The burden of litigating these lawsuits poses a threat to the hunting and shooting sports industry and to the constitutionally-protected right of access to firearms by law-abiding citizens.”

The lawsuit was initially thrown out last October when a judge ruled the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act protected Remington and. Under the act, firearms manufacturers and dealers are protected if a firearm they produced or sold was used in a crime.

The plaintiffs in the case are asking for an exemption to this law because they claim Remington marketed the firearm used, a Bushmaster XM-15, in a way that kept people from knowing just how dangerous the gun could be.

“All AR-15s, whether designated an M16 or, in this case, a Bushmaster XM15-E2S, are built for mass casualty assaults. Semiautomatic fire unleashes a torrent of bullets in a matter of seconds; large-capacity magazines allow for prolonged assaults; and powerful muzzle velocity makes each hit catastrophic,” an Amicus Curiae Brief, filed by the victims’ families reads. “The combined effect of these mechanical features is more wounds, of greater severity, in more victims, in less time.
On a pleasant summer evening, tens of thousands of Londoners walk through or enjoy themselves in the neighborhood the terrorists attacked. Three men armed with high-capacity firearms would not have killed seven and wounded 48: They would have killed hundreds or even more. British police could use their firepower advantage to kill the three terrorists in eight minutes. Had the terrorists been equally armed, who knows what the outcome of the gun battle might have been?

Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!

Amid a flurry of other comments after the London attack, the president of the United States tweeted the following:

British law tightly restricts guns. Would-be gun owners must apply for permission, explaining their reasons for wanting a firearm and producing references to their mental stability and good character. They must prove that their weapons will be safely stored. Weapons that fire bullets, as opposed to shot, may only be used only in pre-approved places: a deer-stalking reserve for example or a certified shooting range. The result, according to the BBC:

[In England and Wales] there are 138,728 people certificated to hold firearms and they own 435,383 weapons. There are 574,946 shotgun certificates which cover 1.4 million shotguns. Statistics for Scotland show that 70,839 firearms were held by 26,072 certificate holders at the end of last year. Some 50,000 people in Scotland are certificated to hold shotguns - and 137,768 weapons are covered by that scheme.

Illegal weapons do circulate of course in the U.K. To obtain them, however, a would-be terrorist would need both considerable cash (a black-market Glock costs upward of 2,000 pounds) and access to an organized criminal network. A self-radicalized amateur jihadi will lack both. In only one of all the completed and attempted Islamic terrorist atrocities in the U.K. since 9/11 did the killers even carry a single gun: a 90-year-old Dutch revolver so battered that they never tried to use it.

Over time, it seems that weapons are becoming harder to obtain. Firearms offenses of all kinds have tumbled from 24,094 in 2004 to 7,866 in 2015. The majority of the 2015 offenses involved what police call “junk guns”: Weapons originally built for other purposes—firing tear-gas cartridges for example—then re-engineered to shoot a bullet.

British tabloids made big news out of the seizure in 2014 of a huge cache of illegal arms: 453 weapons and 200,000 rounds of ammunition from an obsessive gun collector. More typical of the state of the market is the second-largest seizure: 31 rifles and 1,000 rounds in 2013.

Americans would not tolerate British-style rules, nor perhaps should they. But it’s utterly far-fetched to argue—as President Trump seems to be arguing—that Britain would be more safe from terrorism if the London Bridge killers could have obtained an American-style arsenal, or if the targets of the attack had carried weapons of their own, filling the crowded space with hundreds of rounds of panicky return fire.

Police believe "multiple shooters" were involved in a gunfight that left at least 17 people injured at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Officers said via Twitter that all the victims at the Power Ultra Lounge are alive and one who was previously listed in critical condition is now stable.

#UPDATE as of now ALL 17 confirmed shooting victims are alive. We will provide additional updates as needed. — Little Rock Police (@LRpolice) July 1, 2017

A video posted online by Instagram user themelaninpot showed that a packed house showed up to hear Finese 2Tymes, a performer from Memphis, Tennessee.

About a half-minute into a break in the raucous concert, several bursts of gunfire rang out — more than 24 shots in an 11-second period.

Themelaninpot said: "Shooting in #littlerock #arkansas this is outrageous. Our hearts and prayers go out to everyone there.

"If you know of anyone there please check on them. We have to save our state because this is getting out of hand."

Not all of the 17 clubbers who were injured were shot - a number of people were trampled as people rushed away from the shooter, according to officers.

"One is too many. Seventeen is very alarming and certainly disturbing," Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters.

He said there was "some sort of dispute broke out between people inside" the club and that there are "probably multiple shooting suspects".

Police are continuing to investigate but say they do not "believe this incident was an active shooter or terror related incident".

The club's Facebook page promoted Friday night's show with a poster depicting a man pointing what appears to be a gun at the camera. A call to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes' booking agent wasn't immediately returned early Saturday.

Months after taking to Twitter to say he would send in “the Feds” to help reduce Chicago’s murder rate, President Trump’s administration has sent in agents to combat the ongoing violence.

The Chicago Sun-Times first reported that about 20 additional agents with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have been sent to the city.

Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed Friday that the federal government is sending help, while decrying the crime epidemic on the city’s streets.

“Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year!” Trump tweeted.

Sessions also told “Fox & Friends” that his department is assisting.

“We’ll have an impact in reducing shootings in Chicago,” he said, while saying police there are “demoralized” and city policies are not working.

…
The grant will be given by Google.org, an arm of the search giant that provides money and resources to nonprofit organizations, and go to the PICO LIVE FREE Campaign.

That campaign focuses on reducing gun violence, especially in minority communities centered in major cities. The new initiative it’s creating with the grant will involve gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Americans for Responsible Solutions, Guns Down America, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Alliance for Gun Responsibility.

The money will primarily be spent to “scale up and accelerate the implementation of evidence-based gun violence prevention strategies in cities with high incidents of gun related homicides and shootings” a press release detailing the grant said. Chicago, New York City, Dallas, Oakland, Orlando, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee will be among the cities the campaign focuses on. The campaign said its main goal will be to “support local efforts to reduce homicides by firearms, decrease mass incarceration, and center communities of color in the fight to reduce gun violence in America.”

Image copyright Ronald Grant Image caption Shotguns and air rifles are the only firearms you can legally buy in Japan

Japan has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world. In 2014 there were just six gun deaths, compared to 33,599 in the US. What is the secret?

If you want to buy a gun in Japan you need patience and determination. You have to attend an all-day class, take a written exam and pass a shooting-range test with a mark of at least 95%.

There are also mental health and drugs tests. Your criminal record is checked and police look for links to extremist groups. Then they check your relatives too - and even your work colleagues. And as well as having the power to deny gun licences, police also have sweeping powers to search and seize weapons.

That's not all. Handguns are banned outright. Only shotguns and air rifles are allowed.

The law restricts the number of gun shops. In most of Japan's 40 or so prefectures there can be no more than three, and you can only buy fresh cartridges by returning the spent cartridges you bought on your last visit.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption A photo posed by models - even Japanese gangsters rarely use guns these days

Police must be notified where the gun and the ammunition are stored - and they must be stored separately under lock and key. Police will also inspect guns once a year. And after three years your licence runs out, at which point you have to attend the course and pass the tests again.

This helps explain why mass shootings in Japan are extremely rare. When mass killings occur, the killer most often wields a knife.

My Perfect Country

In a world where a lot is going wrong there is also a lot going right. So what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in ideas around the world that have been truly successful?

The current gun control law was introduced in 1958, but the idea behind the policy dates back centuries.

"Ever since guns entered the country, Japan has always had strict gun laws," says Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence and the author of Gun Baby Gun.

"They are the first nation to impose gun laws in the whole world and I think it laid down a bedrock saying that guns really don't play a part in civilian society."

People were being rewarded for giving up firearms as far back as 1685, a policy Overton describes as "perhaps the first ever gun buyback initiative".

The result is a very low level of gun ownership - 0.6 guns per 100 people in 2007, according to the Small Arms Survey, compared to 6.2 in England and Wales and 88.8 in the US.

"The moment you have guns in society, you will have gun violence but I think it's about the quantity," says Overton. "If you have very few guns in society, you will almost inevitably have low levels of violence."

Japanese police officers rarely use guns and put much greater emphasis on martial arts - all are expected to become a black belt in judo. They spend more time practising kendo (fighting with bamboo swords) than learning how to use firearms.

"The response to violence is never violence, it's always to de-escalate it. Only six shots were fired by Japanese police nationwide [in 2015]," says journalist Anthony Berteaux. "What most Japanese police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station to calm them down."

Overton contrasts this with the American model, which he says has been "to militarise the police".

"If you have too many police pulling out guns at the first instance of crime, you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals," he says.

To underline the taboo attached to inappropriate use of weapons, an officer who used his gun to kill himself was charged posthumously with a criminal offence. He carried out the act while on duty - policemen never carry weapons off-duty, leaving them at the station when they finish their shift.

The care police take with firearms is mirrored in the self-defence forces.

Journalist Jake Adelstein once attended a shooting practice, which ended with the gathering up of the bullet casings - and there was great concern when one turned out to be missing.

"One bullet shell was unaccounted for - one shell had fallen behind one of the targets - and nobody was allowed to leave the facilities until they found the shell," he says.

There is no clamour in Japan for gun regulations to be relaxed, says Berteaux. "A lot of it stems from this post-war sentiment of pacifism that the war was horrible and we can never have that again," he explains.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption There are a limited number of longstanding rifle owners in Japan - when they die their heirs must hand the rifles in

"People assume that peace is always going to exist and when you have a culture like that you don't really feel the need to arm yourself or have an object that disrupts that peace."

In fact, moves to expand the role of Japan's self-defence forces in foreign peacekeeping operations have caused concern in some quarters.

"It is unknown territory," says political science professor Koichi Nakano. "Maybe the government will try to normalise occasional death in the self-defence force and perhaps even try to glorify the exercise of weapons?"

According to Iain Overton, the "almost taboo level of rejection" of guns in Japan means that the country is "edging towards a perfect place" - though he points out that Iceland also achieves a very low rate of gun crime, despite a much higher level of gun ownership.

Henrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London applauds the Japanese for not viewing gun ownership as "a civil liberty", and rejecting the idea of firearms as "something you use to defend your property against others".

But for Japanese gangsters the tight gun control laws are a problem. Yakuza gun crime has sharply declined in the last 15 years, but those who continue to carry firearms have to find ingenious ways of smuggling them into the country.

"The criminals pack the guns inside of a tuna so it looks like a frozen tuna," says retired police officer Tahei Ogawa. "But we have discovered cases where they have actually hidden a gun inside."

Republicans Keep Missing the Point About Gun Control—Even When They're the Targets

Photo Credit: Mark Van Scyoc / Shutterstock

Gun rights activists for years have fought for the free proliferation of firearms throughout the U.S., perhaps subconsciously imagining they were only arming themselves. But a shooting incident in Virginia on Wednesday, in which a 66-year- old white man named James T. Hodgkinson fired a rifle multiple times on a baseball field and seriously injured House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others, illustrated this point: Liberals, who traditionally support gun control, also may use gun violence when they feel helpless.

Hodgkinson, apparently a strong critic of President Donald Trump, reportedly inquired before shooting whether “the team practicing was a Democrat or a Republican team,” and he was informed that it was comprised of Republicans. National Rifle Association proponents including Scalise—who has an A+ rating from the gun-rights group—may do well to acknowledge that living in a society flooded with guns is dangerous for them as well as for the rest of us.

Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., one of Trump’s most ardent backers in Congress, wasted no time blaming Democrats for the shooting, saying, “I can only hope that the Democrats do tone down the rhetoric. ... The rhetoric has been outrageous: The finger-pointing, the tone, the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters, really then, some people react to things like that, people get angry as well, and you fuel the fires.”

Collins, who has now vowed to carry his gun in public, acts as if gun fatalities spurred by right-wing rhetoric did not exist—and he is not alone. For example, when Robert Lewis Dear Jr. fatally shot three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in November 2015 while heated anti-abortion debates were taking place in Congress, Republican leaders refused to link their rhetoric to Dear’s actions. And over the past year, violent right-wing rhetoric and hate crimes have have risen concurrent to Trump’s presidential campaign concurrent to Trump’s presidential campaign, his election, and the early months of his tenure in the White House.

The Democrats have been strong in their language against the GOP and Trump’s agenda—it is easier to be principled when one is in the minority. But the nominally liberal party pales in comparison to its rival, which took the concept of an opposition party to new depths during the Obama administration. Add guns to our politically polarized society’s volatile mix that conservatives have stoked harder than anyone, and you have an explosive situation—literally.

Like many mass shooters, Hodgkinson had a history of domestic violence, which because of Republican intransigence over gun control laws, had no impact upon his ability to legally obtain a deadly weapon. Upon finding out that Hodgkinson volunteered for his campaign and supported his presidential bid, Sen. Bernie Sanders said he was “sickened by this despicable act.” While the progressive response to gun violence has usually been to push for stricter gun control, the Republican reaction has been to lay the blame anywhere but on the easy availability of guns. In essence, we are expected to tone down our rhetoric and walk on eggshells lest we piss off our gun-toting fellow Americans or tempt them into using their weapon to obtain “justice.”

It has been just over a year since the deadly mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, where nearly 50 mostly black and brown queer Americans were gunned down. Because the shooter happened to be a brown-skinned Muslim man, that incident was dubbed “the nation’s worst terror attack since 9/11,” even though there was no evidence of actual collusion between the shooter, Omar Mateen, and outside political organizations. Apparently the only requirements for labeling an incident “terrorist” are the skin color and/or religious background of the shooter. In the wake of that mass shooting, Republicans ardently professed their “thoughts and prayers,” but thanks in large part to their unwavering allegiance to the NRA, they remained silent on the shooter’s ability to easily and legally obtain an AR-15 assault rifle.

When coordinated attacks took place on London Bridge and Borough Market in the U.K. in early June, Trump took to Twitter to comment on the incident, saying, “Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That’s because they used knives and a truck!” In addition to insulting the victims with his offhand remarks, Trump failed to recognize that if guns were as easily available in the U.K. as they are in the U.S., the perpetrators would have likely used them to far deadlier effect than they did with a van and knives. It is likely that strict gun control laws in the U.K. greatly reduced the potential death toll. (The issue of how the west’s foreign policy provokes such actions in the first place is another matter entirely, one that politicians of almost all stripes tend to avoid.)

Everyday gun violence is far more devastating than all the “terrorist” incidents in the U.S. put together. On the same day Hodgkinson fired on the Virginia baseball field injuring several people, a disgruntled UPS worker shot and killed four people, including himself, at a delivery center in San Francisco. That incident got far less attention than the baseball field shooting, perhaps because we are numb to gun-related fatalities that have no obvious political aspect. Americans are expected to swallow the fact that more than 30,000 people die of gun violence in the U.S. every year (from homicides and suicides) as an acceptable sacrifice to protect the sanctity of the much-misinterpreted Second Amendment.

Given the political moment we find ourselves in, it appears that even some liberal-minded people are beginning to see guns as a means toward justice (if that is indeed what motivated Hodgkinson to fire his rifle). Our president is disliked by a majority of Americans, as his consistently low popularity ratings reveal. But his supporters happen to overlap significantly with the same forces that insist on the supremacy of guns and gun owners. This is dangerous for us all. There can be no good ending to a society whose democracy is as distorted as ours, a society in which it is easier to obtain a gun than it is to adopt a puppy.

Some liberals and progressives believe in the right to self-defense by arming oneself with guns. Indeed, members of the Black Panther Party, heroes of the 1960s-era-era black Black power Power movement, used the right to bear arms cleverly in their struggle for racial equality. It was a political move, with optics designed to inspire fear and some admiration among the group’s critics. But in today’s America, it is foolhardy to imagine that more people brandishing weapons will achieve anything other than more needless bloodshed.

In examining war zones around the world, the flow of weapons is the greatest source of death and destruction. The U.S. stands out on the world stage for providing weapons to governments, even regimes with atrocious human rights records. . It is no surprise that our government is obsessed internally and externally with disseminating firearms. The U.S. left has rightfully criticized our weapons sales in the realm of foreign policy. We should apply that same critique internally. Scientists agree that the mere presence of guns dramatically increases the potential for violence. It makes little sense therefore for some progressives to argue in support of arming themselves. The answer to gun violence cannot be more guns.

We already live with the brutality of poverty, deportations, incarceration, medical bankruptcy, job insecurity, student debt, racial inequality and so much more. Gun availability is an added and terrifying ingredient in the mix of American violence. Sadly, as a nation, we seem to have given up on the issue of gun control now that the Republicans are in control of Congress, the White House and, increasingly, the Supreme Court.

But the GOP should be careful what it wishes for. Pro-gun Republicans will not be happy to have guns trained on them by armed Americans disgruntled with government policies. Even if it scores political points to blame Democrats, Republicans’ lives are at stake as well. The only path to safety for us all is to control guns as strictly as most other nations have. Then the violence of American discourse can remain rhetorical rather than actualized, and we can get on to the important job of fixing the nation’s many problems without fear of being shot.
Police in the south-east city of Avignon say the mosque was not targeted in the attack

Eight people including a girl were lightly wounded late on Sunday in a shooting in front of a mosque in the south-east French city of Avignon, the prosecutor’s office said, ruling out terrorism.



According to initial accounts taken on the spot, at least two men got out of a car around 10.30pm near the mosque and opened fire, including with a shotgun,.

None of the wounded had life-threatening injuries, it said.

“From what we know this evening, the mosque was not targeted. The fact that it happened in the street of the religious establishment was unconnected with it,” the prosecutor said.

Witness accounts mentioned four men in the car, all hooded. The criminal investigation department has taken charge of the case.

La Provence regional newspaper, which first reported the incident, cited a judicial source as saying police are “not at all treating it as terrorist related” and suspected instead a dispute between youths.

Four people were wounded outside the mosque while a family of four in their apartment 50 metres away were hit by shrapnel, La Provence said.

The shooting comes a few days after a man on Thursday attempted to drive his car into worshippers outside the Creteil mosque in south-east Paris.

The driver, a 43-year-old Armenian who suffered from schizophrenia, hit barriers and pillars outside the mosque with his car without causing any injuries, before crashing into a traffic island.

According to a source close to the investigation, the suspect had made “confused remarks in relation” to a string of jihadist attacks that have struck France, killing 239 people since 2015.

Following a van attack against worshippers leaving Finsbury Park mosque in London on 19 June which left one dead and 11 injured, France’s Muslim community has also felt threatened.

Some Muslim officials have described the Paris incident as an attack and called on the authorities to “strengthen protection of places of worship”.

France is on high security alert following a series of militant attacks in recent years.

In the fall of 2005, the city of New York was preparing a mammoth lawsuit against 14 gun manufacturers and 27 distributors and dealers. The suit set out to prove that the gun industry bore a responsibility for the volume of guns illegally trafficked into the city.

To make its case, the city had marshaled significant evidence showing that gun manufacturers were unwilling to take simple steps to keep their guns out of criminals’ hands—and even knowingly fed the criminal gun market. The lawsuit highlighted federal data from 1996 to 1998 that had traced more than 34,000 guns used to perpetrate crimes back to just 137 dealers. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms informed gun manufacturers every time a gun used in a crime was traced to their companies, information that would have made it easy for manufacturers to determine which of their distributors and dealers were supplying the black market, yet manufacturers continued to sell guns to those “bad apple” dealers.

As the trial neared, the city had marketing experts, dealers, and former gun industry officials ready to testify that the gun manufacturers’ lack of oversight of their dealers and distributors could only be attributed to a willful blindness that allowed them to profit off the criminal gun market. The city’s lawyers were prepared to argue that in Southern states with lax gun laws, manufacturers supplied dealers with more handguns than the legal market could consume, knowing the excess guns would be trafficked north up the I-95 corridor and sold illegally in cities like New York.

“New York was a very strong case,” says Jonathan Lowy, an attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence who worked on the case. “We were completely ready for trial.”

But the trial never came. In October 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), granting sweeping legal immunity to the gun industry. Gun manufacturers who lobbied for the bill warned that suits like New York’s were a scheme hatched by activist lawyers and judges to bankrupt the gun industry. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), named the New York case on the Senate floor as an example “of the predatory lawsuits” that the PLCAA aimed “to provide for the dismissal of.”

After the PLCAA passed, New York’s case was thrown out. The city never got its day in court.

More than a decade after its passage, the PLCAA is at the center of a fierce debate over gun control between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. As a senator from New York in 2005, Clinton voted against the PLCAA; Sanders, then in the House of Representatives, voted for it, as he had done for an earlier iteration of the measure that failed in 2003. Recently, Clinton has accused Sanders of bowing to the National Rifle Association on this key piece of legislation. Sanders, who hails from a rural state with lax gun laws, has defended his vote as a way to protect the “small mom-and-pop gun shop” in Vermont from frivolous lawsuits.

But Sanders’ argument obfuscates the true impact of his vote—namely, that the lawsuits he helped derail once represented the most viable effort in decades to stem the flow of guns onto the black market.

Sanders’ current position on immunity is not entirely clear. In the latest Democratic presidential debate, he said he would take a second look at the bill. His campaign announced earlier this month that he would support proposed legislation to roll back immunity for gun manufacturers. (The campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story.)

The lawsuits Sanders helped derail once represented the most viable effort in decades to stem the flow of guns onto the black market.

But Sanders has also recently defended the PLCAA by making the same arguments that the gun manufacturers made a decade ago. “If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?” Sanders asked during the first Democratic debate in October. “Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about.”

To Lowy, Sanders’ hammer analogy is misleading. “The idea he’s getting at is, if all you did is make or sell a product that’s used in a crime, you shouldn’t be liable,” says Lowy, who has litigated cases for the Brady Center for 18 years. “And he’s exactly right. But the lawsuits that I was involved in aren’t premised on that theory. Our theory is that the gun companies did something wrong: They didn’t use reasonable care.”

The New York suit was part of a legal experiment in the late 1990s and early 2000s to curb gun violence by holding manufacturers, distributors, and dealers liable for gun violence in cities across the country. Though many of these suits sought damages, the ultimate goal of the litigation was to force the industry to oversee its supply chain—to exercise “reasonable care” by taking steps that could preclude a foreseeable harm to others—and help cut off easy access to guns for straw purchasers and traffickers.

Beginning in the 1980s, victims of gun violence and their families started filing lawsuits against the stores that sold guns to their assailants, and later against the manufacturers as well. Then, in the late 1990s, cities and counties started to get involved. Throughout the decade, states had filed a deluge of lawsuits against the tobacco industry for deceptively marketing a deadly product, and some ultimately succeeded in winning historic settlements in the late 1990s. The tobacco litigation held a major industry accountable for the dangers of its products and forced producers to the bargaining table. Lawyers at the Brady Center wondered if guns could be the next tobacco.

On October 30, 1998, New Orleans became the first city to file suit against a gun manufacturer. A few weeks later, Chicago became the second. Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, a Democrat who led a gun violence task force within the US Conference of Mayors at the time, urged other cities to follow their lead. Within a year, 30 cities and counties had filed suits against more than 40 gun manufacturers.

Some of the suits focused on manufactures’ failure to incorporate safety systems into their weapons. But others, like New York’s, argued that gun manufacturers facilitated the illegal gun market through lax oversight of their distributors. These suits were based on the legal principle of negligence, the idea that an individual or company is liable if it fails to exercise reasonable care. In many industries, manufacturers monitor their products from the factory to the distributors to the market. For example, due to the risk of food-borne illness, the food industry has developed its own set of food safety protocols, beyond what federal regulators require, to manage its downstream distributors. But the gun industry engages in remarkably little oversight. So the lawsuits sought to establish through the courts what gun control advocates couldn’t accomplish through state legislatures or in Washington: liability for gun manufacturers who don’t oversee their supply chain.

“What the gun industry chose to do was, at best, put their heads in the sand and ignore the reality that they were utilizing these bad-apple gun dealers,” says Lowy. “They knew that if they acted reasonably and put some reasonable oversight and conditions on the downstream sellers they would end up losing profits from the criminal gun market.”

The negligence argument against the gun industry was untested. “When you read the papers written by the lawyers for the gun companies, I mean, it was daunting,” recalls Allen Rostron, a lawyer who joined the Brady Center in 1999. “I thought, ‘Boy, we might lose every single one of these.'” Many cities’ suits were tossed out of court. But a few survived and began to inch toward trial.

With mixed results in the courthouse, press coverage of the lawsuits gave an immediate public-relations boost to gun control advocates. In 1998 and 1999, police officers around Chicago and Detroit embarked on undercover sting operations to purchase guns illegally. Again and again, dealers happily sold their guns to the undercover cops. In one Detroit-area sting in which one officer posed as an illegal buyer and another as a straw purchaser, the gun seller gave instructions to the undercover officer acting as the straw buyer: “When the manager comes over to check this, it’s your gun. You’re not purchasing it for him, it’s your gun…This is called a straw purchase. It’s highly illegal.” The sting was videotaped and later aired on NBC’s Dateline.

“Lawsuits frame issues often differently than the popular culture does,” says Timothy Lytton, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law. “Gun violence up until the 1980s was thought of as a problem of bad apples—criminals who were shooting people—and that it was a crime problem. The tort lawsuits basically reframed this and said, ‘No, the real problem here isn’t criminals. The real problem is industry practices, and…the real focus needs to be placed on the carelessness of industry distribution practices and the responsibility of the industry to police its own supply chain.'”

On St. Patrick’s Day in 2000, the lawsuits appeared to have paid off. Battling multiple suits, Smith & Wesson, the country’s largest handgun manufacturer, agreed to a historic settlement, promising to equip its guns with more safety features and institute a code of conduct for its dealers. President Bill Clinton praised the agreement.

“That really was the high point,” recalls Rostron, now a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law. “People were almost giddy.” The gun industry, for its part, saw the agreement as proof that the lawsuits were an abusive legal tactic that must be stopped. The lawsuits “could force the industry to the settlement table even though [the cities] had weak prospects of actually winning the case, just because of the sheer weight and burden of litigating,” explains Lytton, who edited a book of articles about the gun litigation called Suing the Gun Industry.

Gun control groups hoped other manufacturers would follow Smith & Wesson’s example. Instead, the NRA instigated a boycott against Smith & Wesson. Sales plummeted, Smith & Wesson’s CEO resigned, and the company was sold for a fraction of its former worth. Rather than a breakthrough, the agreement became a major setback.

“It was like Congress was waiting in the wings to see if we had any success and then cut [the cases] off if we did. It was a dismal era for gun control.”

More settlements were now out of the question. Meanwhile, the litigation was getting harder. Under pressure from the NRA, 32 state legislatures passed immunity bills, shutting down many of the lawsuits. Even the Detroit-area case, with the damning sting evidence that had aired on prime-time television, was ultimately thrown out. Then came the election of President George W. Bush later that year. Former Brady Center lawyers point to the election as the death knell for their litigation effort; now the threat of national immunity legislation would hang over every lawsuit.

New York’s lawsuit, initially filed under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican, was advocates’ best chance to strike a blow against the gun industry. The city had been lucky to land a judge who saw merit in the case and wanted it to proceed to trial, an event that would mean front-page headlines for the city’s allegations. But shortly before trial, the PLCAA ended the suit. “It was like Congress was waiting in the wings to see if we had any success and then cut [the cases] off if we did,” says Rostron. “It was a dismal era for gun control.”

After the PLCAA, the city suits came to an end. The Brady Center still litigates cases on behalf of victims, but those suits are an uphill climb under the bill’s broad provisions.

The spate of mass shootings in recent years has sparked a renewed effort to sue the gun industry. The parents of one victim of the shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, tried to sue the online retailers for allegedly failing to assess the shooter’s mental fitness before selling him thousands of rounds of ammunition and body armor, but they lost. Following the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the victims’ families filed a lawsuit against the makers of the Bushmaster rifle, arguing that the manufacturer is negligent in selling assault weapons used for war to the general public. This is a novel legal approach, and it’s unclear how it will fare in court. But sympathy for the victims, and for others in recent mass shootings, has brought new scrutiny to the PLCAA as the Bushmaster case moves forward. Still, the PLCAA could likely end this lawsuit—a fact the Clinton campaign has eagerly pointed out.

In 2013, the New York Times obtained confidential testimony from these city cases in which top executives scoffed at any sort of supply chain oversight. Asked if his company would investigate whether it was supplying shady dealers, one executive testified, “I don’t even know what a gun trafficker is.” And a top executive at Glock proudly stated that his company would continue to supply a dealer who had been charged with breaking gun laws. “This is America,” the executive said. “You’re still innocent until proven guilty.”

Assault weapons on display at The Freedom Shoppe gun store, which was holding a sale in anticipation of new gun control measures, in New Milford, Connecticut, April 2, 2013. (Photo: Wendy Carlson / The New York Times)

Tony was the first gun-toting revolutionary I ever met. A Jewish African-American studies major, he quoted Frantz Fanon in the twilight of the Reagan era. When he popped by the school cafeteria, he was usually upset about something - the frat-boy student government, the state of Black America, a shop owner admonishing a customer, "Don't Jew me." Tony once vowed if a revolt suddenly "went down" in Baltimore, where we went to college, he would join in. "It would be premature," he said, but he would nonetheless grab his assault rifle and give his life fighting alongside the rebelling urban underclass. I thought, "This guy has a death wish."



I didn't realize how right I was. One day in the cafeteria, someone said, "Did you hear about Tony? He killed himself. Gun to the head." Rumor was his young wife and baby daughter were at home when he did it.



I've been thinking about Tony and what he represented in terms of the left's relationship to guns. Namely, why is it that so many leftists - and by leftists, I'm referring to self-described radicals and revolutionaries, not liberals - are against gun control?

Despite the Aurora and Newtown massacres, it's almost impossible to pass effective gun-control measures. It's not enough to attribute lax gun laws to our founding mythology, a violent culture or the power of the gun lobby. After all, same-sex marriage has triumphed, and reproductive rights still exist, despite the same mix of power, money and culture in the opposition's corner.

What's missing from the pro-gun-control camp is a genuine grassroots campaign, and that's where the left comes in. Pick an issue and the left is organizing around it - climate justice, labor, rape culture, immigrant rights. But why not gun control? Because, most leftists, myself included, agree with the principle Tony advocated, which is political violence - meaning collective self-defense - is a necessary though not sufficient means of securing freedom from a violent state.

Before you equate radical with bomb-thrower, realize Americans, with few exceptions, support state violence. Yet some support gun rights and some oppose it. Many leftists are in the former camp. To confirm this, I asked a couple thousand Facebook "friends" if they opposed gun control and their reasons why. The responses came pouring in:

"Is a state monopoly on arms in the best interests of the working class?"

"Gun laws, much like drug laws, are used to oppress the poor and people of color."

"We can't have a revolution without them."

"Governments already have too much of a monopoly on violence and we will one day have to bring this one down."

"I'll be damned a cop can have a gun but I can't."

"Gun control laws ... are another step down the incline to a full-fledged police state."



"[I support] the right to bear arms - because I'm horrified that racist whites are heavily armed in areas of the country that oppose democratic rights."

Judging from these comments, many leftists agree with the right that the biggest threat to society is not mentally ill shooters like Adam Lanza. It's the state. The implication is that the solution to a society with too many guns is more guns. That's why leftists tend to shrug off gun control. They see it as impinging on their freedom, or at least as something that doesn't affect them.

But I'm rethinking this position and now conclude that a society awash in guns is more of a detriment to the left project of emancipation than a means to secure it.

This is not an abstract argument. Obama's gun-control push is on the ropes after the bill banning semi-automatic pistols and weapons, as well as high-capacity magazines, died in the Senate. Remaining measures include providing resources for school "tip lines, surveillance equipment, secured entrances" - such as metal detectors and armed police - and enabling the use of National Guard troops to "ensure schools are safe." That's right. The response to guns in schools is to put soldiers cradling machine guns in schools.

Without bottom-up pressure, like the campaign that's blocked the Keystone XL pipeline thus far, legislation is beholden to those with the most money and lobbyists, in this case the NRA and gun manufacturers. As liberals and gun-control NGOs play an inside game, they lack the skills, base and inclination to organize the kind of movement that can disrupt the balance of forces.

Loathe to grant the state more power, leftists have sat out the gun debate. However, every Aurora and Newtown convinces a terrified public to trade civil liberties for security, allowing the police, already equipped with tanks, armed helicopters and drones, to gain more weapons, more powers, more surveillance and less oversight. Ironically, much of the left's energy is focused on reining in police powers, such as campaigns spearheaded by Cop Watch, Stolen Lives, INCITE!, and Critical Resistance, and extending to projects led by liberals and libertarians in the NAACP, ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Thus, the left should connect the dots by framing gun restrictions as part of the effort to limit police powers, abuses and surveillance. Unlike the right, the left does not believe the state of nature is a war of all against all. Central to the left project is demilitarizing society, and by using this as the umbrella, gun control can provide an opening to shackle the state instead of the people. But first, the left needs to rethink the role that violence plays in social change.

Let me explain. My journey was different than Tony's (he was an ex-Marine), even though I arrived at the same conclusion, that violence from below is often legitimate. I began my political education devouring works by Gandhi, King and Gene Sharp, solidifying my belief that nonviolence alone would triumph. Reading the Managua Lectures by Noam Chomsky shattered my naiveté. In his signature style, Chomsky mined the official record to demonstrate how the US government greets peaceful change with violent terror. President John F. Kennedy admitted as much in 1962 when he said, "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable." With shamefully few exceptions, conservatives and liberals, corporations and unions, pundits and intellectuals, supported the cold war.

Soon, I was marching in support of armed revolutionaries in El Salvador and South Africa. At the same time, I was being arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience, alongside storied Catholic pacifists like Philip Berrigan and Elizabeth McAlister, to oppose US policies repressing these movements.

There is nothing contradictory about the two approaches. The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front in El Salvador and the African National Congress in South Africa calibrated the mix of violent and nonviolent tactics that would best advance their struggles according to "the constellation of forces." Movements turn to violence after nonviolence alone proves futile, as in Southern Africa, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Iran, Palestine, Guatemala and Syria. Of course, popular violence is often defeated, and some violent tactics, like suicide bombings, are self-defeating. A New York Times article on nonviolent resistance in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh observes that Palestinians there "insisted they had the right to armed resistance; they just don't think it works." As such, they viewed suicide bombings not as "a moral error so much as a strategic one."

Nonviolence can work for limited campaigns or to change the political class, as the civil rights movement and Egypt's democratic revolt did. But rarely, if ever, does nonviolence uproot the old order. Governments crush nonviolent movements all the time, as in Czechoslovakia and Mexico in 1968, Uzbekistan in 2005, and Bahrain in 2011. Nonviolent resistance alone is futile against the Pentagon, as proved by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. As for the Indian independence struggle, it left relatively untouched caste divisions, the grip of rural landholders over the peasantry and the capitalist economy.

One has to dissect the social context: What are your vision and goals? Who is in your camp? Who is sitting on the fence? Who opposes you? Only then can a movement determine which tactics are likely to build support and power that can undermine their opponents while bringing their vision to fruition. This analytical process becomes evident in when and how leftists decide which armed resistance movements to support.

For example, when Israel, the US muscle in the Middle East, pummeled Lebanon in 2006, leading left-wing intellectuals, including Chomsky, Gore Vidal, Howard Zinn, Judith Butler, John Berger, Eduardo Galeano, Arundhati Roy, Tariq Ali and Ken Loach, published a "Statement in Solidarity with the Peoples of Lebanon and Palestine." It decried "The deliberate and systematic destruction of Lebanon's social infrastructure by the Israeli air force [as] a war crime, designed to reduce that country to the status of an Israeli-US protectorate," and offered "our solidarity and support to the victims of this brutality and to those who mount a resistance against it." On one level, it's an unremarkable statement, as the right to resist illegal wars and occupations is enshrined in international law. But they were also boldly acknowledging that only Hezbollah's trained army, not protests, tweets or petitions, could counter Israeli aggression.

The domestic situation is more complex. H. Rap Brown hit the bull's-eye when he quipped, "Violence ... is as American as cherry pie." The mile markers of US history are colonization, genocide, slavery, the American Revolution, Manifest Destiny, the Civil War, World Wars, cold war, Korea, Vietnam and globe-spanning coups, counter-revolutions, drug wars, proxy wars, secret wars, drone wars and the war on terror.

The public, liberals included, reflexively backs state violence. Only in America is a state headed by a Nobel Peace Prize winner who's bombed seven countries and asserts the right to globalized kidnapping, torture and secret kill lists not seen as the grotesque absurdity it is. On top of that, Americans gorge on violent movies, television, video games and sports, as they blindly support state violence - a mere 4 percent of the public "strongly opposes" drone strikes against terrorist "suspects" - but they will denounce "violent anarchists" if a scrawny black bloc protester smashes a Starbucks window. The left wants to overturn this order, but it knows the hammer will come down on it for anything but peaceful dissent. So the left has shunned violence for years. Some hapless youth might get ensnared in FBI terror plots, but left-wing leaders aren't making threats about "Second Amendment remedies" or brandishing guns and placards invoking the warning, "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

Despite living in a deeply violent society, armed resistance is suicidal, as even Tony recognized. So I call myself a "strategic pacifist," meaning violence is counterproductive under present conditions. Even property destruction has become self-defeating, as shown last year on the West Coast, where prosecutors jumped on incidents of window-breaking to repress Occupy Wall Street-related movements. At the same time, I argue that categorical pacifism - secular advocates of which are about as common as green penguins - is ahistorical and apolitical because it imposes a one-size-fits-all ideology, denying the specifics of history and the political constraints every movement faces. It's so rare, in fact, that a few years ago, while talking with fellow activists at the War Resisters League, it dawned on us that not one was an absolute pacifist. Many people claim to be antiwar, but a little prodding will get them to admit World War II or the American Civil War was justified.

This is the contradiction at the heart of the left's relation to guns. Despite its peaceful character, the left is unwilling to abandon the idea of violence. As Malcolm X put it: "By any means necessary." Therefore, allowing the state to circumscribe gun rights means surrendering power.

There is a flaw in this formula, however. Popular violence is merely an instrument to bring about an ideal society free of violence. While violence against the US government is inevitable abroad, does it make sense here? One of the few public intellectuals to engage with popular violence is Slavoj Žižek, who writes: "every act of violence against the state on the part of the oppressed is ultimately 'defensive.' ... for the oppressed, violence is always legitimate (since their very status is the result of the violence they are exposed to), but never necessary (it will always be a matter of strategy whether or not use violence against the enemy)."

That's the rub. The main strategic concern for social movements is not to declare war on the state, but to create broad-based organizations that can first resist through every peaceful means possible. That involves maximizing public space in which to organize while minimizing state repression. Public space was essential to Occupy Wall Street's success, and OWS still hasn't recovered from the violent evictions. But it's a fallacy to equate violence as a means to one day overthrow the state with violence as a means of protection for movements to claim public space.

This is why many leftists fetishize guns as Tony did. It's easier to feel the power in the cold steel of a rifle barrel than to trust the arduous path of building a collective movement that may yield social power years down the road, if you're lucky.

I got a taste of this false sense of power during ex-cop Chris Dorner's war against the LAPD. The paranoia in Los Angeles was palpable, with the incessant thump of choppers, jumpy cops and locked-down schools. The police verified Dorner's bitter manifesto by shooting up innocents and neighborhoods, and engaging in what appears to have been his pre-meditated murder. Dorner was lionized as a folk hero - with tens of thousands of people liking dozens of Facebook pages - and one commentator comparing him to a real-life Django Unchained. But Dorner's rampage also bolstered support for the police, and you won't build a movement by celebrating mass murder.

In this light, support for Dorner, as well as for gun rights, is a sign of social impotence. I think Tony gravitated to guns for that reason: weakness, not strength. They were his solution to a troubled society and his own troubled life. Likewise, the left looks for silver bullets to its predicament of powerlessness. Refusing to engage with the state doesn't make it disappear; it just becomes a bigger threat. Trying to use the state apparatus to constrict the state is tricky, but many cherished freedoms - from habeas corpus to abortion rights to freedom of speech and assembly - involve precisely that. Otherwise, we sit back and watch as the state grows more powerful and society grows more violent.
WEST GOSHEN, PA. — Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan took a deep breath, looked through a row of TV cameras toward the family of 18-year-old Bianca Roberson and announced Sunday morning the man police believe pulled the trigger in a road-rage shooting that snuffed out her promising young life was in custody.

Hogan announced first-degree murder charges against David Desper, 28, of the 1200 block of Anderson Avenue in Trainer, Delaware County. Desper turned himself in to West Goshen police with his attorney at 2 a.m. Sunday.

Hogan was joined by West Goshen police at a Sunday morning press conference to announce that an avalanche of tips from the public led first to the red pickup truck that was the subject of a nationwide search, then to the gun used to end a young life, and then to the suspect.

Desper faces charges of first- and third-degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime with intent, and recklessly endangering another person in what Hogan called “a savage, brutal act.”

Hogan said that because Desper was charged with a capital offense, no bail would be set. He was arraigned early Sunday and remanded to Chester County Prison.

Hogan said that a dented and faded red Chevy Silverado C1500, matching the physical description of the vehicle recorded in videos, was registered to Desper and recovered at 58 Huntingdon Farm Drive in Glen Mills.

The firearm and truck were found at separate locations, the D.A. said.

Hogan said a crucial piece of evidence actually came from the body of the recent Rustin High School graduate. Fragments of a .40-caliber bullet consistent with being fired from a Smith and Wesson .40-caliber semi-automatic handgun were discovered.

Police executed a search of Desper’s residence, and a .40-caliber handgun was found in the defendant’s bedroom, Hogan said. In a nearby trash can, .40-caliber ammunition was discovered, the D.A. added.

Hogan said Desper purchased the gun legally on Nov. 5, 2015, and had a permit to carry the firearm.

Hogan referred to the confrontation as a “savage, senseless and brutal act,” noting the victim was “gunned down because somebody didn’t want to give way” on a roadway.

The district attorney said the young teen driver was doing something residents do routinely “thousands of times every day.”

Roberson was trying to merge at the 0.1-mile marker of the Route 100 Bypass at Route 202, when she engaged the suspect. She was killed instantly by a single bullet to the left side of the head.

“It is the exact same thing that all of us do every day — merging safely,” Hogan said. “The act of pulling a gun, aiming a gun and being able to shoot someone in the head from one vehicle to another is a calculated act.”

Hogan noted the massive law enforcement effort that unfolded soon after the fatal encounter, which occurred 5:30 Wednesday afternoon. The D.A. said 20 police officers and staffers from the District Attorney’s office worked around-the-clock during the four-day investigation, launching a manhunt that captured the attention of the nation, even being covered by the nightly network news.

“We looked at all of the red pickup trucks across the region and everyone with a gun permit,” Hogan said.

The D.A. said that the homicide investigation will continue until “justice is done” for Bianca Roberson.

West Goshen Township Police Chief Joseph Gleason gave his condolences to the Roberson family and said he was appreciative of the work by both local and surrounding police.

“They were relentless in their quest,” Gleason said. “I’m very proud of their work.”

He also thanked the media for getting the word out about the case. He lauded the community for rallying around the Roberson family, and pushing updates out on social media like “wildfire.”

Police in West Goshen fielded hundreds of tips from all corners of the nation. Police reviewed video tapes from surveillance cameras along Route 100, as well as neighboring residences and businesses.

Police theorize that after the shooting, the suspect fled along the shoulder of Route 100 at a high rate of speed, exiting at Paoli Pike and eventually taking Route 352 south into Delaware County. That bit of news Saturday night pushed the investigation into the neighboring county.

Meanwhile, family and friends gathered outside the Roberson family home in West Goshen to honor the young woman who was headed to Jacksonville University in Florida in just a few weeks to start her college career.

Roberson had been shopping for new clothes at Main Street at Exton with family members and had just left to drive home when she encountered the suspect on Route 100.

Police theorize she and the driver of the pickup truck started jockeying for position where Route 100 narrows to a single lane.

Roberson’s father, Rodney Roberson, said the family was excited that his daughter was going away to Jacksonville University in Florida to study psychology. She had set her sights on a FBI career.

“She was everything to me, everything, everything,” Roberson said. “I can’t imagine anybody wanting to hurt my daughter. She never hurt anyone. She made you laugh.”

Roberson’s aunt, Mari Hatton-Haynes, said that her niece enjoyed drawing and was a “happy-go-lucky person who enjoyed life.”

Neighbor Sean Endrey was one of the hundreds holding a candle at Friday night’s vigil as darkness fell.

“It’s important for us to not only show support but show she lives on,” he said. “It’s good for us, but the purpose is to show our support and connection to her no matter how big or small.”

This was the second child the Roberson family has lost. An older brother passed away several years ago from a heart condition.

“Knowing what they’re going through, not once but twice,” lamented family friend Steve Lyons.

Rodney Roberson told the group that everyone knows his daughter was not a bad person.

“We hope this guy is caught to bring justice for our daughter,” Rodney Roberson told the throng. “It touches our hearts that you all came out to support our daughter.”

The Pennsylvania Crimestoppers organization offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case.

Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, near the site of Wednesday’s shooting in Alexandria, Va. “As with any constitutional provision in the Bill of Rights, there are adverse aspects to each of those rights that we enjoy as people,” he said.

WASHINGTON — Shaken and angry, Republican members of Congress seized on the brazen daytime shooting of their colleagues on Wednesday to demand that existing restrictions on gun access be loosened so that people facing similar attacks are able to defend themselves.

Past shootings have brought calls for more gun control, especially for restrictions on the kind of rifle used in Wednesday’s attack. But the ardent supporters of gun rights who came under fire this time were not about to change their views.

As Representative Steve Scalise, the third-ranking House Republican, had surgery for a gunshot wound to the hip, his colleagues complained that Washington’s restrictive gun laws had barred him and other lawmakers who live in the capital from bringing weapons to the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.

The Run-Up The podcast that makes sense of the most delirious stretch of the 2016 campaign.

“Had there not been a member of House leadership present, there would have been no police present, and it would have become the largest act of political terrorism in years, if not ever,” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia said, pointing to legislation he has introduced to make it easier for people to carry a gun in Washington. That bill “would allow the most law-abiding among us to defend themselves,” he said.

Republicans who had gathered for the morning workout before Thursday night’s annual congressional baseball game were blunt about their sense of vulnerability.

“The field was essentially a killing field,” said Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who was there when the shooting happened. “You had no way to defend yourself.”

The emboldened response on the right illustrated how much the center of gravity has shifted in the gun debate. As Republican lawmakers grow more uniformly conservative and centered outside urban areas, few prominent voices in the party are willing to support gun control measures.

This is a striking departure from recent political history, when clashes over gun rights often fell along regional rather than partisan lines. The Republican majorities on Capitol Hill have blocked every attempt to enact significant gun control legislation, most recently after the massacre of 49 people in an Orlando, Fla., nightclub last June. Measures to block people on the federal terrorism watch list from buying weapons and to close background-check loopholes failed in the Senate.

And that was before President Trump was elected with far more help from the National Rifle Association than Mitt Romney got in 2012. Mr. Trump received more money from the N.R.A. than any other outside group.

“You came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you,” he told N.R.A. members at the group’s annual convention in April, the first time a president had addressed such a gathering in person since Ronald Reagan. “The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.”

With no appetite in Congress or the White House for restrictions on gun access, Democrats have become all but resigned to inaction. And with one of their colleagues in critical condition, many were muted on Wednesday.

“The problem is that nobody looks for a middle ground,” said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee.

Mr. Cohen said part of the difficulty was that many Republicans in right-leaning districts are more afraid of conservative primary challengers than of Democrats in general elections. And few interest groups have as much clout among Republican primary voters as the N.R.A.

“They have an N.R.A. rating they want to keep,” he said.

Stymied in Washington, gun control activists have taken their fight to state capitals, city halls and corporate boardrooms.

“This is a marathon,” said Shannon Watts, who leads Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group that sprang up after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

Ms. Watts reeled off the gun restrictions the group has helped enact since shifting its focus away from Congress. Seven states have passed laws tightening the sale of firearms at gun shows since the Newtown massacre, and retailers such as Target and Chipotle have begun asking patrons not to bring in weapons. Any new federal laws, she conceded, would take several more elections.

As for the calls from Republicans to empower more people to carry weapons, Ms. Watts said, “if more guns and fewer laws was the best solution, we would be the safest country in the world.”

But with death threats against members of Congress already on the rise before Wednesday, Republican leaders are in no mood to rethink their gun rights stances.

Mr. Garrett, who has received threats this year, said it was not only lawmakers who deserved the right to protect themselves.

“There shouldn’t be one standard for members of Congress and another for citizens who otherwise have the same right to self-defense,” he said.

To many Republicans, the issue is fundamental.

Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, who helped apply a tourniquet on Mr. Scalise, wasted no time dismissing a question at the Capitol about whether his views on gun rights had changed.

“As with any constitutional provision in the Bill of Rights, there are adverse aspects to each of those rights that we enjoy as people,” Mr. Brooks said. “And what we just saw here is one of the bad side effects of someone not exercising those rights properly.”

Sixty-eight people were busted in two statewide drug, guns and violent offenses sweeps this week.

Sixty people were busted in a month-long round-up operation conducted between June 1, 2017 and 23 by the State Police and Newark authorities. Eight individuals from across the state were also busted on drug charges this week in the Newark area on the 400-block of Irvine Turner Boulevard.

Arrested for drug possession were: Arnold Franklin, 62, charged with heroin possession and an outstanding warrant; and Vincent Mendez, 59, charged with heroin and cocaine possession and an outstanding warrant. Both men are from Newark.

The following suspects, all from Elizabeth, were also arrested: Bryant McMorris, 54, and Jeorge Davila, 49, both charged with heroin possession; and Victor Thomas, 57, and Cynthia Jackson, 55, both charged with wandering with the intent to purchase drugs.

Victor Lloyd, 50, of Irvington, was also arrested and charged with heroin possession, as was Janice Bowers, 56, of Bound Brook, who is charged with wandering with the intent to purchase drugs.

“I commend the members of the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office Narcotics Task Force, including members of the Newark Police Division, for their vigilance in addressing citizen concerns and arresting those in possession of CDS or wandering to purchase CDS,” Director Anthony Ambrose said. “These law enforcement officers responded to residents’ complaints and took the necessary action to rid their neighborhood of this criminal activity.”

The State Police operation, meanwhile, targeted 181 violent offenders with open warrants. A summary of these arrests include suspects wanted for illegal weapon possession, narcotics offenses, robbery, theft and shooting warrants.

The operation included the arrest of:

Jihad Anderson, 21, who was wanted following his June 1, 2017 arrest on charges of aggravated assault, unlawful possession of a weapon (handgun) and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.

Radee S. Foye, 18, was also wanted following his June 14, 2017 arrest on charges of unlawful possession of a weapon (handgun) and possession of prohibited weapons.

Dawud Q. West, 28, was wanted following his June 16, 2017 arrest on charges of possession of a prohibited weapon (sawed-off shotgun) as well as possession of a defaced firearm.

Each of these suspects is from Newark.



“I commend the officers, detectives and supervisors who facilitated the success of this operation from both the Newark Police Division and the New Jersey State Police,” Ambrose said. “Removing violent offenders from our streets results in safer neighborhoods and enhanced quality of life for our residents and visitors.”

"This massive roundup sends a message to the good, law abiding residents of Newark that we will not allow wanted criminals to roam freely with impunity," said Colonel Rick Fuentes, Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police. "We will continue to work diligently with Newark Police, and I commend all of the troopers and officers involved with this operation."

Director Ambrose is urging anyone with information about any individual with an outstanding warrant to call the Department's 24-hour Crime Stopper tip line at 1-877-NWK-TIPS (1-877-695-8477) or 1-877-NWK-GUNS (1-877-695-4867). All anonymous Crime Stopper tips are kept confidential and could result in a reward.

BU Study Measures Impact of Gun-Control Laws Identifies state laws that substantially reduce deaths

More than 90 people are killed by guns every day in the United States. In 2013, there were 33,636 gun deaths in this country. Civilians own approximately 270 million guns, roughly one “for every man, woman, and child,” as President Obama noted in an address to the nation in the wake of the shooting rampage at an Oregon community college last October that left 10 dead.

Now, a nationwide study led by Boston University researchers analyzing the impact of gun-control laws in the United States has found that just 9 of 25 state laws are effective in reducing firearm deaths. The researchers used data from 2010 in their analyses.

The study, published March 10 in The Lancet, suggests that three laws implemented in some states could reduce gun deaths by more than 80 percent if they were adopted nationwide. Laws requiring firearm identification through ballistic imprinting or microstamping were found to reduce the projected mortality risk by 84 percent, ammunition background checks reduced it by 82 percent, and universal background checks for all gun purchases reduced it by 61 percent.

Federal implementation of all three laws was projected to reduce the national firearm death rate—10.1 per 100,000 people in 2010—to 0.16 per 100,000, the study says.

“Very few of the existing state-specific firearms laws are associated with reduced mortality, and this evidence underscores the importance of focusing on relevant and effective firearms legislation,” says study senior author Sandro Galea, dean of the BU School of Public Health. “Implementing universal background checks for the purchase of firearms or ammunition and firearm identification nationally could substantially reduce mortality in the United States.”

Study lead author Bindu Kalesan, a School of Medicine research associate and director of the department of medicine’s Evans Center for Translational Epidemiology and Comparative Effectiveness Research, says the study is the first to assess a broad array of gun laws and other relevant state-level data.

“The findings suggest that very few of the existing state gun-control laws actually reduce gun deaths, highlighting the importance of focusing on relevant and effective gun legislation,” notes Kalesan. “Background checks for all people buying guns and ammunition, including private sales, are the most effective laws we have to reduce the number of gun deaths in the United States.”

The research team constructed a state-level dataset using counts of firearm-related deaths in each state in 2010, information on 25 state laws implemented in 2009, and state-specific characteristics that included gun ownership rates, nonfirearm homicide rates, and unemployment rates. Of the 25 laws, 9 were associated with reductions in mortality, while 9 others—such as the so-called “stand your ground” laws, allowing individuals to use deadly force in self-defense when faced with a perceived threat—were associated with increased mortality; 7 other laws were found to have no correlation with gun-related death rates.

The researchers used a statistical model to determine the independent association of various firearms laws with gun-related homicides, suicides, and overall deaths. They also projected the potential reduction of mortality rates if the three most effective firearms laws were enacted at the federal level.

Laws requiring background checks for both guns and ammunition were the most effective legislation identified in the study, showing the protective effect of state laws that close loopholes in the federal Brady Law, which requires criminal background checks only for guns sold through licensed firearms dealers.

Only seven states had universal background checks in 2010, while just three states had firearm identification laws that require ballistics identification or microstamping of guns that leave markings on the cartridge cases they expel when fired, making it possible to link the cases to particular guns.

The authors noted that their findings corroborated an earlier, smaller state-level study that found local background checks were associated with a 22 percent lower homicide rate.

In 2010, 31,672 gun deaths were recorded, equivalent to 10.1 deaths per 100,000 people. Analyzed by state, Hawaii had the lowest rate (3.31 per 100,000), and Alaska had the highest rate (20.3 per 100,000).

The link between state levels of gun ownership and gun deaths has been well established, but less is known about the effectiveness of existing gun laws. The states have introduced a broad range of laws to strengthen or deregulate the Brady Law. However, about 40 percent of all gun sales are estimated to be private transactions (thus not covered by the Brady Law) that do not require background checks.

Study coauthors were from Columbia University and the University of Bern, Switzerland.

Alcohol and Drug Presence in Fatal Motor Vehicle Crashes

In 2012, there were 2,546 crash deaths. Of those, 1,497 deaths, or 58.8%, involved drivers who had some alcohol and/or drug presence in their systems.

476 deaths, or 18.7%, occurred in crashes involving drivers with a positive alcohol reading.

614 deaths, or 24.1%, occurred in crashes involving drivers with a positive drug reading. Cannabis was the drug most frequently found.

407 deaths, or 16%, occurred in crashes involving drivers with positive readings for both alcohol and drugs.

Please note that these statistics document the presence of alcohol and/or drugs and do not reflect impairment levels. The statistics reflect the growing rate of drug presence in drivers involved in fatal crashes. In fact, drugs are now present more often than alcohol in drivers involved in fatal crashes.

Sacramento is using the Fourth of July holiday weekend to bring change and hope to the Oak Park neighborhood.

The police department said while overall crime is down in the area, a string of shootings is striking a chord in the community.

Mayor Darrell Steinberg, along with the police and fire departments, hosted two events this weekend to build relationships in the community.

“This is a nice day. Beautiful day. Everybody is out having fun today,” Oak Park resident Yolanda Ashford said. “It draws people out, and you know, we get closer to the police officers on a daily basis. We know each other. And if they answer the call, they know me.”

The events included a peace walk in Oak Park on Friday, and a community BBQ at McClatchy Park on Sunday.

“The walk was absolutely impressive,” Sacramento Police Capt. James Beezley said. “All of the neighbors coming out, giving us a thumbs up, honking their horns and it wasn’t always that way. A little divisiveness in years past.”

Three separate shootings in less than two months killed two men, and injured three others. In one instance, a pregnant woman was shot, inducing her pregnancy early. Both she, and her newborn, are expected to survive.

“There was just so much violence going on at the beginning of summer -- people losing their lives -- we just had to escalate our response,” Pastor Anthony Sadler said. “An infusion of a little bit of hope. We didn’t resolve everything. The threat of gun violence still exists.”

In addition to the weekend events, Steinberg added an additional 30 officers to patrol the Oak Park neighborhood, and the Oak Park Community Center will remain open until 11 p.m. on Monday.

“Now, it’s the hard work. Now, it’s the sit down and figure it out,” Sadler said. “I think through love, and the relationships that can be building that love, anything is possible. I have to think that. It keeps me getting up.”
