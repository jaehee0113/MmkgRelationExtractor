A henna-decorated performer from Guirab illustrates a cultural contrast that has produced harmony: Palestinians, thought to have played a version of the bagpipe much earlier, were reintroduced to it under British rule between 1920 and 1948.

It's 4 p.m. on a sweltering June Saturday at Bourj al-Shamali. That means it is time for bagpipe practice at this Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon. Lined up two by two, 14 young men and women advance up the stage steps in the peach-colored community center's rehearsal room, the bleating of their bagpipes drowning out the muezzin call for afternoon prayers.

They march with sharp military precision, in marked contrast to the chaos and tumultuous unpredictability that life in the refugee camp brings.

The pipe and drum corps, named Guirab, teaches children as young as 8 not only music, but self-esteem. Since launching in 1996, Guirab has grown to 40 members. Under often unspeakably harsh living conditions, the budding musicians learn self-reliance, pride, and responsibility. Discipline is stressed – practice starts sharply at the top of the hour. No stragglers allowed.

The bagpipe band has played throughout much of Europe, including in Norway and a 17-city Italian tour. Guirab was the only Arab music group tapped to participate in France's Interceltic Festival of Lorient, a celebration of all things Celtic that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year. In October, they will return to Italy.

Guirab's mission is simple: to break down stereotypes through music by creating a bond that words often cannot. "If you make a speech, maybe people don't care who's talking, but the international language is the music," says Mahmoud Aljoma, who runs the social care and vocational training center that houses the bagpipe band.

"There are bad things in the media outside," Mr. Aljoma says. "Sometimes, they think you are Palestinian, you are living in the camps, you are a terrorist. They think like this, and this is not true."

The band resurrects the music that some believe the Palestinians may have played as early as the 12th century. What is known for sure is that the Palestinians were reintroduced to the bagpipe while under British rule from 1920 to 1948.

Guirab plays British bagpipe melodies, but often throws in Arabic rhythms as well, using a traditional Arabic goblet-shaped hand drum, called a dorbaki, alongside the snare drums. There are no kilts here: The women in Guirab perform in brightly colored hijabs; men wear kaffiyehs and embroidered vests. Today, they all rehearse in modified sailor suits with intricate stitching on their lapels.

Aljoma, who has lived in Bourj al-Shamali since 1960, has run the center since 1986. It is supported by Beit Atfal Assumoud, a nongovernmental organization that operates similar centers for children, many of them orphaned, in 10 of the 12 official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.

"Their life is closed in front of them, so I started thinking how to make some program to [help] the [children] to feel they are human," Aljoma says of the refugees. Although Palestinians aren't permitted to own property in Lebanon, are barred from at least 70 professions, and don't qualify for any of the country's social services, "it is possible to give hope to the people," he says.

Established in 1956 following the 1948 displacement of the Palestinians after the establishment of Israel, Bourj al-Shamali lies on the outskirts of Tyre, the fourth largest city in Lebanon, located less than 25 miles from the Israeli border. Fields of lush banana plants and lemon trees, as well as beautifully preserved Roman ruins, nestle up against the Mediterranean in the town once conquered by Alexander the Great. The camp's original 7,000 refugees have swelled to 20,000 in roughly the same space as when it opened.

With funding coming primarily from private donations and international non- governmental organizations (NGOs), the four-floor Bourj al-Shamali center is an oasis – colorful drawings of Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf highlight the kindergarten class walls – amid a makeshift city of dilapidated concrete buildings. Metal rods stick up from crumbling plaster slabs due to lack of building materials in what Beit Atfal Assumoud calls the poorest refugee camp. Many apartments, some of which house up to 11 people in 650-square-foot apartments, have leaking, corrugated zinc roofs and broken windows. Power cables and drying laundry are strung up haphazardly between buildings across narrow passageways.

One of Guirab's leaders, 29-year-old Ahmad Mhouad al-Joumah was 13 when he started coming to the center as a refuge from the camp's abject conditions. "I found this place was like a protection for me," he says. "Protection from violence; from many things in our society."

Even in a refuge, every step can be a struggle. Guirab bought its first bagpipes from families in Lebanon. They were old and in disrepair. Chanters were broken and mouthpieces so misshapen that the musicians' lips often bled during practice. Mr. Joumah laughs when he recalls those early days: "In the beginning, it was very difficult. You need a lot of pushing air and energy."

After years of well-meaning, but often misguided, self-instruction, a trained musician taught the students the correct way to play. Then, after performing in Lorient in 2006, came another, more tangible gift: The mayor of Brittany in France promised 10 new bagpipes at the cost of 2,000 euros each.

Traveling to Europe and the exposure to a way of life far beyond most Palestinians' reach can be painful. "I cry when I see places very nice and quiet and a place for children to play and nice streets and houses," Joumah says. "I feel sad because I think of the people in the camp and how we are living and how I grew up in this very bad condition and like a refugee. For us it's like a war."

But the rewards are also great. The music provides "a peaceful language between me and the other people," Joumah says. "We went to France. I never know these people in France, but they like me and they clap and they smile in my face."

The trips are paid for primarily by NGOs, which also help secure the visas. Additionally, each of the 250 children, called scouts, who use the center, pays 1,000 Lebanese pounds (70 cents) each month. This teaches them "to respect the regime in their life, build the character for the young," Aljoma says. "One important law for the scout: Do a good thing every day ... that helps to face the troubles [and] to build your character."

When a bagpipe player reaches 20, he or she becomes an instructor to the younger children in the program as a way to not only give back, but, more practically, to sustain the band. The older members, "they are getting married and having to go to work," Aljoma says. "So I think during any moment, they are unable to play bagpipes because they have another life."

Guirab avoids aligning itself with either Islamic militant Hamas or secular rival Fatah. "We do not belong to any party; we belong to our people," Aljoma says, although he hints at some troubles with the highly conservative Hamas. "They hated us to play music [and that] the two genders sit with each other," he says.

"This is the reason I love the bagpipe musical group – because we are equal," says 25-year-old Katia Abo Kharoub, who has been playing the bagpipes for more than a decade.

That feeling is what keeps Joumah coming back as well. But for him, it is the sense of equality he feels with the rest of the world when he plays music.

Ask Joumah what he receives from playing in the band and his answer is simple: "For us, from these bad conditions we want to show the people and to give a very good message about Palestinians: that we are like you; we can play music like you; we can smile; we can be like other people."

Despite describing himself as a victim, a man guilty of child pornography and sexually assaulting minors was handed a 12-year sentence Friday.

Part of that term includes a conviction for obstructing justice when Tanzirul Alam, through hundreds of phone calls while in the Calgary Remand Centre, convinced one of his victims to lie in court for him.

Alam abused his three underage female victims and the justice system itself, said Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Sandy Park.

“He showed disdain for the judicial system, it is a very serious offence,” said Park, who also noted Alam’s sexual crimes spanned 3 1/2 years.

“The girls were in fact child victims … children must be protected from themselves because of their lack of maturity and foresight and adults must not be allowed to exploit those vulnerabilities.”

The man was convicted of 17 offences involving the girls, ages 14 and 15, including sexual assault, sexual contact with a person under 16, luring, making and transmitting child pornography and obstruction.

His victims were lured on the Internet, which soon led to sexual acts that were recorded on video, some of the images being shared on the Internet.

“The potential for a lifelong impact on the complainants is acknowledged by this court,” said Park.

He also noted Alam continued his sex crimes while on release from the remand centre in 2014.

In a nearly 20-minute statement to the court, Alam, 29, insisted his difficult upbringing in Bangladesh, which included being tortured by Al-Qaeda-linked terrorists, contributed to his offences in Canada.

He said the Canadian government does a poor job in educating newcomers like him to the country’s legal realities and predicted more refugees would be committing similar offences.

“I believe, in a way, I’m a victim of a system that is not perfect,” said Alam, who apologized to his victims, one of whom looked on.

“My intention was never to hurt you … I’m not heartless.”

Park said Alam “lies to serve his own purposes but has some remorse as shown in his statement.”

Because of his obstructive conduct while in remand, Park reduced most of Alam’s credit for time served from the usual 1.5 days to 1.25 days for each day spent in lockup.

That means he’ll serve eight years and eight months before parole eligibility.

It’s an “awesome, meaningful sentence,” said Crown prosecutor Donna Spaner, adding it employs tough sentencing guidelines established by the previous federal Tory government.

“It’s a recognition of Parliament’s intent to criminalize predatory matters of Internet exploitation of children,” she said. “That’s a manslaughter sentence.”

Spaner also derided Alam’s statement as “self-serving” nonsense and said his warnings about refugees were false and potentially damaging.

The mother of one of the victims said she was happy with the sentence and hopes the prison time will help Alam and the community.

“He will not be free for a very long time, and with any luck, he will get some mental help and rehabilitation while in prison, so that upon his release he will never do these seriously damaging, disgusting crimes to anyone ever again,” said the woman, who can’t be named to protect the identities of the victims.

The sovereignty of America is quietly being eroded as details have emerged surrounding the Obama administrations proposed budget for 2017 in regards to the resettlement of refugees and illegal aliens in our cities and towns. In early February of 2016 the Obama administration unveiled their plans under the innocuous sounding budget proposal for fiscal year 2017 (FY 2017) titled the Administration For Children and Families Refugee and Entrant Assistance program.

The Refugee and Entrant Assistance account, according to the proposal, helps refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, Survivors of torture, Special Immigrant Visa holders, and trafficking victims to become integrated and successful members of American society. The requested budget by the President for fiscal year 2017, which begins October 1, 2016, is $2,184,860,000. According to the White House over $2 billion in funds are needed in order to “support a total of 213,000 ‘humanitarian arrivals’ in Fiscal Year 2017, including 100,000 refugees, consistent with the administrations commitment to admit at least this number of refugees in 2017.”

Moreover, the account is also responsible for coordinating and implementing the care and placement of illegal aliens, which the administration refers to as “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UC) who are apprehended by immigration authorities while their immigration cases are pending and referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). The UC program provides shelter, counseling, medical care, legal services, and other support services to children in ORR custody. Meaning, not only is the administration not deporting these individuals, but they are also paying for their legal services in order to challenge in court the very laws they have just broken. The FY 2017 request also includes $1,226,000,000 in base funding for the UC program, which is an increase of $278,000,000 from FY 2016 enacted level (of $948,000,000) and the same total resource level.

Anticipating that there will be more refugees and more “unaccompanied children” flowing across our southern border later this year, the Obama administration budget request creates a contingency fund that would trigger additional funding of another $400,000,000. In Obama speak, this basically means that this “contingency fund” will be drained.

In short, the U.S. Refugee Resettlement business is massive and includes both government and non-governmental organizations as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) works in conjunction with the Health and Human Services (HHS) department in order to uphold what they label as “America’s humanitarian response to refugees through the U.S. Resettlement Program (USRP).”

According to the ORR website, once the United Nations and U.S. embassies refer refugee cases for resettlement consideration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers at DHS conduct individual interviews and clearances, and final determinations for admission. From there, the State Department’s Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) coordinates admissions and allocations to specific cities and resettlement agencies, in conjunction with nine national voluntary agencies that oversee a network of some 250 affiliates in 49 states plus the District of Columbia through the Reception & Placement Program.

The nine national voluntary agencies, also known as VOLAGs, operate under the auspices of being “charitable” and “religious” organizations while they receive billions of dollars from the federal government to resettle refugees and asylees without any input whatsoever from the citizens living in the cities and towns in which the refugees are resettled. These ‘Voluntary Agencies’ known as VOLAGs are listed below with their acronyms and can be viewed by clicking on each agency:

Additionally, there are 350 subcontractors in 190 cities affiliated with the nine main refugee VOLAGs. Moreover, as the ORR website explains, from the date of arrival, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at HHS provides short-term cash and medical assistance to new arrivals, as well as case management services, English as a Foreign Language classes, and job readiness and employment services – all designed to facilitate refugees successful transition in the U.S., and help them to attain self-sufficiency. The cities and towns where these nine VOLAGs are currently operating is listed below. To view the map in full simply click on the image provided by the State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.

These nine non-governmental organizations have been awarded over $4 billion in awards and grants since 2008 and represent an enormous threat to the sovereignty of our nation as they lobby congress to push for more refugees and in turn more money. It’s a symbiotic relationship in which most Americans are deliberately kept in the dark about while congress is outright complicit in continuing to fund it. As James Simpson of the Center for Security Policy notes that due to these nine VOLAGs being non-governmental organizations, “they can and do lobby for advantageous changes to law and build allies in congress and the bureaucracy, all fertilized by an open spigot of taxpayer dollars.” While it may seem complicating given that there are numerous departments, agencies, programs, and organizations working in conjunction to undermine our nation, it all boils down to money in the form of “resettling” refugees and illegals throughout our country.

The Obama administration and the media as well as congress for that matter would like to keep you in the dark about this. Yet, hidden on page 269 of the 469 page Obama budget proposal is an extremely startling statistic in regards to how many refugees, Special Immigrant Visas, Cuban and Haitian Entrants, Trafficking victims, and Unaccompanied Alien Children this administration has admitted into the country. The chart below outlines this astronomical amount and can be found on page 269 of the President’s Budget request for the Administration for Children and

Families (ACF).

Since 2009 the grand total of individuals this administration has admitted into our country is 1,034,277. This is astounding given that the administration is now calling for a quarter of a million people to be admitted in 2017 while asking for over $2 billion in funds and if you think a Republican controlled congress would never dare to allocate such funds for this invasion, think again because the budget proposal notes that the Republican controlled congress in 2015 allocated $1,396,313,000 for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance program while further increasing the funding in 2016 to a total of $1,952,691,000. The FY 2017 request includes $1,226,000,000 in base funding for the UC program, which is an increase of $278,000,000 from the FY 2016 enacted level of $948,000,000.

The sheer amount of money being allocated by congress to fund what is essentially an invasion of the third-world in the form of refugees and illegal aliens is outright treasonous in my opinion. For example, there is no way that congress has been aloof as funding for illegal immigrant children or “unaccompanied children” over the past five years alone has jumped from $267,211,000 in 2012 to $948,000,000 in 2016. Moreover, congress is also allowing this administration to ignore the national security implications of allowing hundreds of thousands of refugees, particularly from Syria, to flood our country even as the FBI has stated that they have no way of properly vetting the 2,500 Syrian refugees that we’ve already accepted.

So what can the ordinary American citizen do to stop the invasion of our nation? For starters, visit the Refugee Processing Center Affiliate Directory listed here and become aware of these organizations operating in your state. Contact these organizations via email, phone, or directly at their address and let them know you’re aware of their agenda. Furthermore, use that directory as a reference and contact your local and state representatives. Demand that these organizations be shut down if they are operating in your city or town. Do not let your representative claim ignorance and if they refuse to listen to you, let them know that you will do everything in your power to ensure that they are never elected again. Remember it is all about money for these various “charitable” and “religious” non-governmental organizations. They don’t give a damn about your safety or your concerns, they only care about remaining on the government payroll. It’s past time that we the people do everything we can to get them off of it.

Story highlights Sesame Street & the International Rescue Committee are teaming up to educate displaced children in refugee camps

Elmo says "it's important to help people when they need help"

(CNN) Sesame Street's Elmo says refugee kids are just like kids everywhere.

"They like to play and learn just like Elmo and all his friends at Sesame street" he said during a Facebook Live interview with CNN on Monday.

The 3 1/2-year-old Sesame street character visited a refugee camp in Jordan back in February, and described the trip as "really wonderful because Elmo got to meet a lot of new friends."

"Elmo thinks it's important to know that everybody is the same deep down and that's very important."

Elmo also noted some of the differences between kids here and there. "It was really sad because Elmo's new friends told Elmo that they had to leave their homes because it wasn't safe for them to stay," he said. "And that made Elmo really sad and sometimes a bit scared."

Refugee who lives in the immigration detention centre suffered serious injuries when he was allegedly robbed by locals, advocates say

A man who was allegedly attacked with knives during a robbery on Manus Island last week needs to be brought to Australia for medical treatment, advocates have said.

The man, a refugee living at the Australian-run immigration detention centre, suffered serious injuries on Wednesday morning when he was allegedly robbed by some locals, according to the Kurdish-Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani.

Another man was also robbed at knife-point the same day, and two others were robbed just last month. All four are living in the open detention centre.

“This man was walking in the town and then some men held a knife to his body and asked for his belongings,” Boochani said. “When the refugee refused to give his phone to them they attacked his hand with the knife very seriously.”

Photographs purported to be of the man’s injuries show large deep gashes to his arms.

According to advocates, the man has since been flown to Port Moresby for treatment, but they called for him to be brought to Australia to see a specialist surgeon.

Boochani said the other three men were uninjured, but the four incidents were part of an increasing problem with violence in the community and a lack of protection for refugees.



“The Lorengau town has a small population, but the Australian government is trying to settle people there by force even though Manusian people are afraid of having 800 strange men in their community,” said Boochani.

“If anything bad happens to the refugees Australia is responsible.”

The Papua New Guinea police regional commander, David Yapu, told Guardian Australia he had not received a report of such an attack.

Boochani suggested many refugees and asylum seekers had stopped reporting incidents to police because they didn’t think anything would be done.

Around 80 additional police officers have been stationed on Manus recently, due to the PNG national election.

Tensions in the region have been high, with a number of reported attacks on refugees and asylum seekers by locals, and some on locals by asylum seekers or refugees.

Nine people were injured when navy personnel on a “drunken rampage” opened fire on the processing centre on Good Friday.

The human rights lawyer George Newhouse said the alleged attacks were “extremely worrying” as detainees are moved out of the processing centre ahead of its closure in October. The centre has been partially closed, including some accommodation blocks and gym areas.

Non-refugees in Mike compound have been told to “make space” for refugees moving in from Foxtrot compound.



Australian government pays heavy penalty for Manus mistreatment | Richard Ackland Read more

Refugees are able to settle in the community or move into the East Lorengau transit centre, which is being expanded. However there are still concerns it will not be big enough and that refugees are not safe there.

“It’s a shocking irony that people feel safer in detention that they do outside,” said Newhouse. “What does that tell you about the conditions on Manus?”

Earlier this month the Australian government agreed to pay more than $70m to nearly 2,000 men who had been held on Manus, in compensation for illegally detaining them in dangerous conditions.

Newhouse said the Australian government needed to find an alternate place to keep people in the long-term.

“Assuming they aren’t going to be brought to Australia, the Australian government is seeking to abandon these vulnerable people in the community on Manus Island,” he said.

“As I see it the [short-term] solution is to keep the detention centre open so they can maintain the physical safety of those who don’t go to the USA.”

The immigration department said the incident was a matter for the PNG government.

This poem, from Instructions Within (2008), was translated by Jonathan Wright:

You give the world indigestion, and some other problems.

Don’t force the ground to vomit,

and stay close to it, very close.

A fracture that can’t be set,

A fraction that can’t be resolved

or added to the other numbers,

so you give rise to a certain confusion in global statistics.

Being a refugee means standing at the end of the queue

to get a fraction of a country.

Standing is something your grandfather did, without knowing the reason.

And the fraction is you.

The country: a card you put in your wallet with your money.

Money: pieces of paper with pictures of leaders.

Pictures: they stand in for you until you go back.

Going back: a mythical creature that appears in your grandfather’s stories.

Here endeth the first lesson.

The lesson is conveyed to you so that you can learn the second lesson, which is “what do you signify?”

On the Day of Judgment, they stand naked,

and you swim in the spillage from the cracked sewage pipes.

Barefoot – that’s healthy for the feet

but unhealthy for the ground.

For your sake we will set up rostrums and hold conferences,

and the newspapers will write about you in the appropriate manner.

A new formula has been developed to eliminate recalcitrant dirt,

and at only half the price.

Hurry to buy up half the amount,

because the water shortage is very acute.

Serious negotiations

are underway to provide ashes for free so that you won’t choke,

without affecting the right of trees to live on Earth.

Learn how to avoid using up all your ash allowance in one go.

They taught you how to lift your head up

so that you can’t see the dirt on the ground.

They taught you that your mother is the Earth.

And your father?

You’re looking for him to confirm your lineage.

They taught you that your tears are an extravagant waste of water.

And water … as you know!

Tomorrow,

It’ll be a good idea to get rid of you,

because the Earth would look better without you.

Children are like sparrows,

but they don’t build nests in dead trees.

And the U.N. agency isn’t responsible for planting trees.

Use yourself as a bargaining card,

as a piece of paper with a poem on it, a piece of toilet paper,

a piece of paper for your mother to light the stove

and bake some loaves.

The weather forecast:

The sun is lying in bed because it has a temperature.

The bones, clothed in flesh and then with skin.

The skin gets dirty and gives off a horrible smell.

The skin burns and is affected by supernatural factors.

Take yourself as an example.

Don’t give up hope.

Take heart from the exile from which you are fleeing!

This is intensive training for living in Hell

and in your harsh conditions.

My god, is Hell somewhere on Earth?

The prophets have gone into retirement

so don’t expect any prophet to be sent your way for your sake.

For your sake the observers submit daily reports

and are paid high salaries.

How important money is

for the sake of a decent life!

Abu Said’s felafel are exposed to contamination

and the dispensary is announcing that the inoculation campaign is ending

so don’t worry about your children being contaminated

as long as the dispensary is there.

Live coverage of the proceedings of the beauty contest.

That girl looks good in her bikini,

and that one has rather a large bottom.

Breaking news: Sudden Rise in the Number of Deaths

From Smoking.

The sun is still a source of light

and the stars are peeping in at you, because your roof needs

repairing.

An argument at the taxi depot:

“We don’t have enough passengers to leave yet.”

“But my wife is in labour.”

“This is her tenth pregnancy. Hasn’t she learnt anything? There are reports warning of random population growth. Random – that’s the word I’ve been looking for for ages. We’re living in a random world. We’re multiplying and our children stand naked. Sources of inspiration for film-makers, or for discussion around the table at the G8. We are small people but they can’t live without us. For our sake some buildings have fallen down and some railway stations have been blown up. Iron is liable to rust. For our sake there are plenty of picture messages. We are actors who don’t get paid. Our role is to stand as naked as when our mothers gave birth to us, as when the Earth gave birth to us, as the news bulletins gave birth to us, and the multi-page reports, and the villages that border on settlements, and the keys my grandfather carries. My poor grandfather, he didn’t know that the locks had changed. My grandfather, may the doors that open with digital cards curse you and may the sewage water that runs past your grave curse you. May the sky curse you, and not rain. Never mind, your bones can’t grow from under the soil, so the soil is the reason we don’t grow again.

Granddad, I’ll stand in for you on the Day of Judgment, because my private parts are no strangers to the camera.

Do they allow filming on the Day of Judgment?

Granddad, I stand naked every day without any judgment, without anyone needing to blow any last trump, because I have been sent on in advance. I am Hell’s experiment on the planet Earth.

The Hell that has been prepared for refugees.

Aydan Özoğuz, commissioner for immigration, refugees and integration, told the Financial Times that only a quarter to a third of the newcomers would enter the labour market over the next five years, and “for many others we will need up to 10”.

The Institute for Employment Research (IAB) found only 45 per cent of Syrian refugees in Germany have a school-leaving certificate and 23 per cent a college degree.

Statistics from the Federal Labour Agency show the employment rate among refugees stands at just 17 per cent.
Six months ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order shutting out refugees and halting visas from six Muslim-majority countries. But that ban was never implemented, thanks to rulings in two separate federal courts.

That changed on Monday.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration should be permitted to enforce the ban starting on Thursday, June 29. The court did impose some restrictions on the ban, however, including allowing people who already have a valid visa to enter the country.

The ban on refugees remains, though. Refugees will not be allowed to enter America for a period of 120 days — unless they’ve already been issued a visa or have a “bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”

Below is an interview I conducted back in January with Joseph Carens, a professor of political theory at the University of Toronto and a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. The author of The Ethics of Immigration, Carens’s work focuses on the challenges involved in applying democratic principles to immigration policies.

Here, I spoke with Carens about the ethics of Trump’s executive order as well the normative questions it raises about human rights.

Sean Illing

What do you see as the basis of our moral obligations to admit refugees?

Joseph Carens

I think there are at least three overlapping bases for these obligations. The first is that the US is sometimes responsible for the fact that someone has become a refugee. For example, people in Iraq and Afghanistan who have helped American forces by serving as translators or in other capacities have sometimes been put at risk because of this service. There are already stories of such people being excluded from admission (and hence, safety) as a result of Trump’s policy.

The second basis for the obligation to refugees is simply the humanitarian duty to help people in desperate straits when one can do so. This duty has its roots in many different religious and secular ethical traditions. The United States has traditionally admitted more refugees than any other country (although Germany has clearly passed the US in this respect in the past few years). The complete ban on refugee admissions for four months and the subsequent reduction (by half) of the number who will be accepted is a failure to meet America’s humanitarian obligations.

The third basis for the obligation to refugees is that the United States and most other countries have acknowledged that the international state system has a duty to protect refugees. In the wake of the failure of democratic states to protect Jewish refugees from the Nazis, the United States led the effort to create institutions that would prevent such a moral failure in the future. That regime already suffers from severe limitations, and the new Trump policy will undermine it further.

Sean Illing

What are the moral limits on what states can do to individuals in a democratic society, and why is the answer to that question relevant to thinking about immigration policy?

Joseph Carens

I'd say that we have principles that everyone recognizes. For example, people have a right to a fair trial, to freedom of religion, to freedom of speech, to freedom of movement. Now, many of these things are put into the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but there are overlapping rights that are freestanding norms that we have about how you can treat people or what it's reasonable for the government to do. These are basic norms of fairness and reciprocity, principles that we hold to be transcendentally true.

Sean Illing

I’ll stop you there for just a second and ask an obvious question: What do these norms and rights have to do with immigration in particular? I imagine many people will associate these rights with citizenship, or membership in a defined polity.

Joseph Carens

Well, this includes norms about how you can treat noncitizens. People sometimes think that all rights are due to citizenship, but that's just not correct in the empirical or legal or normative sense. So take the right to a fair trial. If you're a noncitizen and you're accused of a crime, you're supposed to be treated exactly the same way a citizen is. You have the same rights that a citizen does in this area. In fact, permanent residents have virtually all the rights that a citizen has except for the right to vote.

In your book, you say that contemporary reflection about refugees begins in the shadow of the Holocaust. Countless Jewish people fled Hitler in search of protection, and most of them did not get it. Do you see Trump’s executive order banning the entry of all refugees for 120 days and those from Syria indefinitely as analogous in any way?

Joseph Carens

Absolutely. I think this is a point that's been made by a number of Jewish groups who are trying to welcome Syrian refugees. It's an irony, as many have noted, that this policy was announced on Holocaust Remembrance Day. At the time of the Holocaust, there were lots of Jews trying to flee Nazi Germany, and many Western states, including America and Canada, refused to accept them.

President Trump's answer to the question of how many Syrian refugees are too many seems to be "none." None is too many. In the wake of World War II, in the wake of seeing what happened, we vowed never to let that happen again, and that's exactly what we're doing in the case of Syria.

These people's lives are at stake, and if the United States turns them away, why do we assume other countries will take them in? And if no one else takes them in, what do we think will happen to them?

Sean Illing

There’s a lot of discussion about the legality of Trump’s executive order, but here I’d like to dive into some of the deeper ethical objections. I’ll start with this: Do you think this policy will produce more suffering than it relieves?

Joseph Carens

The goal of the policy is to reduce the threat of terrorism, but many objectors (rightly) think that the policy’s actual effect will be to increase the threat of terrorism because it will alienate Muslims throughout the world and will confirm the claim of ISIS that the United States is fundamentally hostile to Islam, but it won’t actually aid in preventing the entry of people who might pose a threat.

This is an important, and, in my view, persuasive argument about the likely consequences of the policy, and so a good reason for rejecting it, but it is an ethical argument only in the very limited sense that any policy that causes more harm than good with respect to a legitimate goal (like reducing the threat of terrorism) can be said to be bad from a moral perspective.

Sean Illing

What about the claims that it runs counter to fundamental American values?

Joseph Carens

Openness to immigrants and refugees has played a key role in making the United States what it is today and is a central element in the American ideal. This need not entail denying the reality of practices of marginalization and exclusion of immigrants and refugees at many points in the American past. Rather, it reflects a commitment to live up to the ideal and not to repeat those failures.

This sort of objection to Trump’s policy focuses on values and ideals, and, in that respect, it is clearly a moral argument. On the other hand, within some limits, deciding what you want your country to be is clearly the sort of thing that democratic politics is supposed to be about.

Sean Illing

Perhaps the most essential moral objection is that a policy like this violates basic principles that are supposed to limit or constrain democratic politics. Here I’m thinking of principles of justice, fairness, equality, and individual freedom.

Joseph Carens

I think this policy does that in two obvious ways.

First, in imposing restrictions on entry that take immediate effect, it violates norms of fairness. As everyone knows, the policy has stranded people abroad who had already been living in the United States as well as people who had been given permission to come and had made life plans on that basis. To deprive people of a right to enter the United States that they had previously been granted and which they have done nothing to forfeit is unfair.

The Trump administration has already implicitly acknowledged this moral failure in changing the policy so that it no longer restricts the entry of green card holders (i.e., people entitled to live in the US as permanent residents), but this still leaves a great many people who have done nothing wrong stranded abroad with their lives disrupted. For example, students cannot get in to continue or start their studies, workers with permits other than green cards cannot return, and so on. These exclusions are simply arbitrary.

Second, the policy violates the moral principle that it is wrong to discriminate on the basis of religion. The seven states whose citizens are not permitted entry are all overwhelmingly Muslim. Trump himself has implicitly acknowledged that it is wrong to discriminate on the basis of religion by denying that he is doing so. This recalls the old saying that hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue. In this case, however, the hypocrisy is so blatant, given Trump’s past and present statements about Islam, that no one who cares about reality can take his protestations seriously. This policy is clearly and deliberately aimed at restricting the entry of Muslims.

Sean Illing

Why is the distinction between migrants and refugees so important, and why do refugees have a stronger claim upon host societies for aid and sanctuary?

Joseph Carens

Migrants are people who want to move from one country to another. They may have good reasons for moving or bad reasons for moving. Refugees are people who have a desperate need to move: They're not safe in some fundamental way and they need to leave. So their claim to move is much stronger, and we all recognize that. The United States has signed the Geneva Convention on refugees. Even Trump doesn't deny that refugees have some kind of claim, he's just not willing to meet it. He's concerned about those who are suffering and desperate, but he's not prepared to say what he will do to help them.

Sean Illing

What rights do states have to determine that accepting or admitting refugees imposes unsustainable burdens or risks on their society?

Joseph Carens

Nobody thinks that states have to admit people who actually are terrorists, and so it's reasonable for a state to do some vetting. Nobody thinks a state should admit so many refugees that it cannot function. But in a lot of cases, this involves what one thinks is a reasonable assessment.

So the idea that because someone might be a terrorist, or there's a tiny chance that someone's a terrorist, is not in itself a justification for shutting the doors. There has to be some kind of balance in terms of the judgments we're making. Reasonable people can disagree about what that balance is, but the extreme standard that Trump is using is well beyond the standards of reasonableness.

Sean Illing

There seems to be a problem of distributive justice here in which the burdens of accepting refugees are not dispersed equally across the nations of the world. How do we deal with that given the limits on interstate cooperation?

Joseph Carens

That's an important issue, and there isn't a structural solution to that, there's nothing that can make a state accept refugees. So if the United States refuses to do, there is no one that can force us to do it. But that's a question that every American should ask himself or herself: If we don't take in these refugees, who is going to do it? And why do we think it's reasonable to expect them to do it if we won't? It seems to me that nobody is asking that question.

Right now there are millions of Syrian refugees in countries like Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon, and these are not countries that have caused this crisis in any way. They have no particular responsibility for these refugees, except for the fact that they're next door. But there's no reason to expect these countries to provide new homes for all of these refugees for the rest of their lives, and there's no sign that this conflict will end anytime soon.

Here's the thing: How many people actually ask themselves what will happen to these refugees if we don’t take them in? I think a lot of people blind themselves to this question. They're not willing to contemplate the consequences of refusing entry to these desperate people, and that’s part of the problem.

Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –

According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the number of refugees who entered the U.S. during President Trump’s first three months compared to the last months of President Obama’s term was cut nearly in half.

Hell yeah!

The statistics show that a total of 13,000 refugees were admitted to the U.S. in the past three months, compared to 25,000 under Obama, The Los Angeles Times reported.

The most popular countries of origins remained the same: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Myanmar.

Hussein had set the ceiling of 110,000 refugee arrivals across the U.S.

President Trump cut that number to 50,000 this year.

Congress has approved a budget for only 75,000 for this fiscal year. A U.S. State Department spokesman said the country is now resettling 900 refugee arrivals weekly, to remain within that budget.

THAT’S 900 A WEEK TOO MANY.

WE DON’T WANT THEM HERE.THEY ARE COMPLETELY USELESS AND CAN’T ASSIMILATE TO CIVILIZED SOCIETIES.

THAT’S A FACT JACK!

Fox reports that Trump was praised by many supporters and criticized by others. Erol Kekic, executive director of the Immigration and Refugee Program for Church World Service, said at the time, “This program simply can’t be turned on and off like a faucet.”

Federal court rulings have blocked Trump’s executive orders suspending arrivals from certain majority Muslim nations. But the lower U.S. admissions numbers have disrupted a finely tuned, federally funded process that begins with exhaustive 18-month security screenings abroad.

Trump is moving to significantly reduce the number of refugees allowed to enter the United States, even as his bid to temporarily suspend admissions is stalled in the courts.

The statistics show that the Obama administration made an effort to increase the number of refugees before Trump by 86 percent.

There are more than 63 million refugees worldwide, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

1.4 million U.S. veterans are at risk of homelessness.

This may be due to poverty, overcrowding in government housing, and lack of support networks. Research indicates that those who served in the late Vietnam and post-Vietnam era are at greatest risk of homelessness. War-related disabilities or disorders often contribute to veteran homelessness, including physical disabilities, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury, depression and anxiety, and addiction.

564,708 people in the U.S. are homeless.

According to a recent report, over half a million people were living on the streets, in cars, in homeless shelters, or in subsidized transitional housing during a one-night national survey last January. Of that number, 206,286 were people in families, 358,422 were individuals, and a quarter of the entire group were children.

Yeah, so let’s help our own people before we take in 1 more freaking foreigner.

Sound like a plan?

In early 2001, an Iranian family fled their home and landed in Texas as political refugees.

The mother, who went to medical school in Iran, passed her boards in the US and now works as a psychiatrist; she largely serves children in poverty. Her son, just 15 when they moved here, is now in his last year of residency; he extends the lives of people with cancer. They both work with underserved populations.

So a few weeks ago, when President Donald Trump signed the first executive order temporarily banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries — including Iran — they were shocked.

"How come we are the enemies?" the mother asked.

Physicians who trained in these seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — provide care to a large number of Americans, especially those in areas where domestically trained physicians typically don’t want to work. "This is a population that I enjoy working with. I see ourselves as very useful for the community," the mother told me. (She and her son asked me to withhold their names.)

When the courts struck down the first executive order, she said she was glad to be living in a democracy. “Now, we appreciate democracy more,” she said.

But on Monday, Trump signed a revised executive order — and it affects six of those countries. (Iraq was taken off the list.)

It’s been difficult to precisely measure how much various communities in the US are served by doctors trained from these banned countries. So a handful of researchers gathered data from Doximity, an online networking site for doctors, and shared it with me. The team included the University of Chicago’s Peter Ganong; Harvard University’s Mitra Akhtari, Matthew Basilico, Valentin Bolotnyy, John Coglianese, Jonathan Roth, Adrienne Sabety, and Heather Sarsons; and Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Otis Reid and Michael Stepner.

They analyzed the seven countries the first order affected, and this is what they found:

(View an interactive version of the map here.)

This map shows more than 8,000 physicians who trained in those seven countries. The researchers estimate that these doctors provide 16 million appointments a year. If you exclude doctors trained in Iraq, that’s still more than 7,000 doctors who treated 14 million appointments a year.

What’s most fascinating, though, is where these doctors tend to be concentrated.

Red America relies on these doctors

A disproportionate number of communities that favored Trump during the election rely heavily on these foreign-trained physicians. This includes swaths of areas in the Rust Belt, Midwest, and Deep South.

"The irony of it is: We work in a red state, so the majority of our patients probably voted for Trump," the son said. Just the other day, he said a patient told him she wanted an “American” doctor.

This is partially by design.

The US has a shortage of physicians who want to practice in rural and underserved areas. So as my colleagues Julia Belluz and Sarah Frostenson point out, the US grants visas to foreign doctors if they agree to work in these areas for three years after their residency. These are often in rural and industrial areas that tend to vote Republican.

But Trump's first executive order, which was shot down by the courts, may have already done damage.

The Boston Globe reports that the immigration order puts hospitals in a tough position when ranking which students they want to accept into their residency programs. Med school graduates from these six countries may be barred from coming to the US, so hospital administrators may rank them lower on their list of preferred candidates.

A common ground with other Trump targets: trauma

The mother in our story, who works in El Paso, now provides psychiatric services for many Hispanic children.

She said that recently she has seen many children who are worried that Trump's anti-immigrant policies means their families will be deported. This is the first time kids are coming into her sessions talking about politics — and crying.

But because she's experienced trauma, she says it's helped her care for these children.

"I have lived through the Iran and Iraq wars," she said. "And definitely the understanding I have from living in a war zone helps me understand their trauma much more than someone who hasn't."

“...even if they voted to keep you and your people out”

The family now has citizenship, and much of their fear has subsided since they first arrived just months before 9/11.

The son, who was a teenager at the time, said, "We were really scared what was going to happen to us. We were scare we would be deported for whatever reason. That would've been deadly for us."

He remembers a constant sense of fear — barely understanding English; President George W. Bush giving a speech and saying Iran was part of the "axis of evil"; taking a bus to a college visit, only to be pulled off the bus by Border Patrol and threatened with deportation.

Now, though, he says America is his country, and he's sad for America.

So I asked him: Has he ever thought about whether someone he’s caring for supports the ban?

"As a doctor, you show up to work every day and treat your patients the same," he said, "even if they voted to keep you and your people out of the country. That's your job as a physician. You're supposed to be like that.”
More than 80 refugees from around the world have been given the chance to display their artwork in London.

Two of the participants, Henok and Abdo, arrived in the UK in 2015 as unaccompanied minors, having travelled from Eritrea and Sudan.

With support from the British Red Cross young refugee project, the 18-year-olds both now live in Kent and attend Lewisham college in London.

Through the project the pair have been able to produce a series of artwork on display.

The artwork depicts their lives back home, the journey they took to reach the UK and their hopes for the future.

The ‘All I left behind. All I will discover’ exhibition runs from June 21-25 at the Oxo Tower gallery in London and is free of charge.

A survey conducted by Pew Research Center shows that the 1.3 million asylum seekers that entered Europe in 2015 are overwhelmingly male– not widows and orphans as President Barack Obama claimed last year.

Pew’s research shows that four out of 10 refugees in Europe are young men, aged 18 to 34. Approximately three-fourths (73 percent) of refugees entering Europe in total were male, while 53 percent of all refugees were young adults between the ages of 18 and 34. Individuals hailing from war-torn countries making up a large portion of all refugees were also overwhelmingly male. Syrian refugees were 71 percent male, Iraqi refugees were slightly higher at 75 percent, while Afghan refugees were a remarkable 80 percent male. Refugees from these three countries made up over half of Europe’s refugees in 2015.

Research found that young male refugees make up a large portion of asylum applicants in certain countries. Italy’s applicants were heavily young and male, at 74 percent. Germany, which fell victim to a spat of terror attacks committed by refugees last month, saw 39 percent of asylum applications come from young men. Germany has seen the most applications for resettlement, with 442,000– or 33 percent of all applications in Europe.

The European Union has attempted to disperse refugees evenly across its member states, though Pew’s research shows that the endeavor has largely failed. Eighty-four percent of Syrian refugees traveling to Europe applied for asylum in Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands. The E.U. plans to fine member countries an astronomical $280,000 for each refugee a member country refuses to accept as part of the plan.

Obama lambasted Republican politicians who opposed allowing Syrian refugees into the U.S. after the Paris attacks last November, claiming they were “scared of widows and orphans.” He also accused several former Republican presidential candidates of engaging in rhetoric that serves as a “potent recruitment tool” for the Islamic State.

Legal experts said there are questions surrounding how the new version of the travel ban will be implemented at airports across the country -- which could lead to travel delays for thousands of people in the next few months.

For individuals who are not U.S. citizens and are from one of the six banned countries, will need to prove that they have a "bona fide" relationship with a family, university or entity in order to enter the United States.

Amber Smith, an Associate Attorney with Ferguson Immigration Law, said that it's likely hundreds of others who are traveling, yet not from a Muslim-majority country will be affected.

"Families who are not from one of the six countries could also run into some delays at the airport traveling. Even those who have a "bona fide" relationship with the United States could run into delays, because officials are going to have to determine that relationship is. There isn't clear guidance on how it's going to be implemented," Smith said.

Canopy NWA, a local organization that works to resettle refugees in Northwest Arkansas, said this new ban creates uncertainty for them and the pending resettlement cases they are working on.

"It keeps them in dangerous situations that they shouldn't be in. we are upset by this and we don't really know what to expect," Linn said.

She said the group has more than 20 people who were supposed to come to Northwest Arkansas before October, but the new ban could cause problems for them.

Linn said that the "wording" is vague, and they will need to better understand what constitutes a "bona fide" relationship with the U.S.

She said their hope is to help those whose lives could be in danger, and this new ban will prevent that.

In a Facebook post, the group states: We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court ruling today regarding the travel ban. Parts of the ruling remain unclear and we are not sure to what extent this will affect those who have already been assigned to Canopy, but have yet to arrive.What we do know is that this ruling does affect real people. As policy continues to swing back and forth, the safety and wellbeing of refugee families hang in the balance.Stay tuned for more information. We should have more clarity within the next 72 hours.
Why it matters to you New charity initiative is using smart tech to deliver education to children who would otherwise have no access to it.

As much as we enjoy geeking out over giant mech robot battles and stories about 3D printing in space, one of the most amazing — and amazingly easy to take for granted — aspects of modern technology is the ability to convey information anywhere in the world. That’s something that a new project aimed at teaching kids in the Ampain refugee camp in Western Ghana is taking full advantage of with an education portal.

The organizers are using smart tech — including satellites, solar-powered computer hardware, and an interactive live feed — to deliver two-way lessons to people who otherwise would miss out. According to its organizers at the Varkey Foundation, this is the world’s first satellite-enabled live two-way interactive distance-learning program for children living in refugee camps.

“The Ampain primary school has been fitted with a satellite dish, which, through solar-powered technology, receives a live link to highly qualified teachers in a studio in Accra, who broadcast lessons direct to the refugee camp,” Leonora Dowley, country director for Ghana at the Varkey Foundation, told Digital Trends. “Each classroom has a projector so all the children can see the teacher giving the lessons, and each classroom has also been provided with a computer so that children can interact with the teacher in a direct, live, two-way link. This is much more effective than simply providing children with textbooks, as nothing can beat access to a great teacher.”

The interactive classes have been running since April, with the express aim of helping kids who are currently out of school, or at risk of dropping out of education altogether. The hope is that the project will enable these students to catch up with their basic classes, continue on with secondary education, and learn the language of their host country.

In addition to offering literacy and numeracy lessons, the program also offers after-school sessions aimed at teaching subjects like reproductive health, human rights awareness, financial literacy, and leadership.

“We believe this is a highly replicable solution that could be deployed in other settings,” said Dowley. “Given the extent of the refugee crisis, it will be exciting to see how things could develop on this front in future.”

Last month, a 29-year-old pilot named Shaesta Waiz departed on a solo flight around the world. The goal of her ambitious endeavor is to inspire young women and girls to consider careers in STEM.

NBC News profiled her in honor of last week’s Women in Engineering Day. Waiz was born in a refugee camp and emigrated from Afghanistan to the United States during the Soviet-Afghan War. Her family lived in a poor area of California, and Waiz “assumed … her next stop would be early marriage and motherhood,” according to the website of her non-profit organization Dreams Sonar. But thanks to “a series of positive inflection points,” she became the first person in her family to earn a college degree, and went on to become the world’s first female certified pilot from Afghanistan.

Women are often underrepresented in STEM fields generally, and in the aviation industry in particular. There are about 4,000 women pilots worldwide, making up just three percent of the total industry. “I want to inspire the next generation of female aviation professionals,” she told the CBC last year.

Over the course of 90 days, Waiz will make 30 stops in 18 countries, among them Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and India. You can track her progress on the Dreams Sonar website.

Clooney Has Change Of Heart About Refugees After He’s Forced To Give BIG Chunk Of Money To Muslims

Hypocrisy and double standards are unfortunately par for the course with the rich and famous in America today. They support and throw their substantial support behind policies that will never have any impact on them, but will greatly (usually negatively) impact those of us who don’t live in ivory towers. And for all of their high and mighty rhetoric, they’re rarely ready to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to anything that will impact their day to day life.



Sadly, while many of these policies that they claim to support do end up being passed, they never feel the effects of it, and the rest of the nation is left to deal with the ripple effect.



One such policy that many who live in gated communities and go places with bodyguards support has to do with striking down the immigration and the travel ban that President Trump enacted practically moments after taking office. George Clooney has been in opposition to the ban, citing the fact that his wife is an immigrant from the middle east. However, it looks like when it comes to actually laying down the cash, he’s not quite down with that.
Engineers, scientists, students, tech companies and non-profit organizations are just a number of the individuals and groups that celebrated International Women in Engineering Day worldwide for the first time Friday.

Its widespread effort aims to inspire women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), ultimately diminishing the gender disparity that exists in those fields.

While more women have expressed interest in studying the STEM fields over the last 10 years, the number of women in engineering has stayed the same since the early 2000s, according to the Society of Women Engineers. Just 18 percent of computer science graduates today are women — less than half of what it was in 1984, according to data from Girls Who Code, a non-profit aimed at advancing women in technology fields.

From coding to aviation engineering, these women are thinking outside the box to promote STEM.

Born in a refugee camp and escaping with her family to the United States from Afghanistan after the Soviet-Afghan war in 1987, Shaesta Waiz grew up to become the first certified female pilot from Afghanistan. She’s also the first person in her family to earn a bachelor’s and master’s degree.

After growing up in a poor area of California, Waiz believed her future consisted of “getting married at a young age and starting a big family.” But at age 18, she discovered aviation and felt that she finally “had a purpose.”

Waiz started the non-profit organization “Dreams Soar” to encourage girls to explore professional opportunities in STEM. “Young girls don’t know about these careers and they don’t have a role model that inspires them to want to pursue engineering or STEM fields,” she said.

The 29-year-old is currently flying solo around the world to meet with women in aviation and to promote STEM education. Waiz is making 30 stops in 18 countries in approximately 90 days. Her route includes visits to the United Arab Emirates, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore.

Former elementary school teacher turned documentary filmmaker Katie McEntire Wiatt found her true calling after a student said to her, “Girls aren’t good at math, so that’s why I can’t do math.” After personally witnessing the gap in confidence that young female students felt about math, Wiatt was inspired to put an end to this outdated notion by making a film about it.

Her film "Fly Like A Girl" centers around the contributions women have made to aviation and engineering. The documentary seeks to highlight hidden figures in STEM and to inspire women to explore careers in those fields. “A lot of time we don’t get to see these women until something extraordinary happens. But it’s really those everyday women who are doing incredible things,” Wiatt said.

Sisters Julia and Christina Tartaglia started the Scientista Foundation out of Harvard in 2011 -- Julia was a senior and Christina had graduated two years earlier. They launched the organization to “address the lack of resources, community and role models for college women in science and engineering.”

The non-profit enables pre-professional women in STEM to network with female scientists at their own school and at campuses across the country. It also provides members with funding, access to job postings and opportunities to connect with high-profile females in STEM. Since its launch, more than 30 colleges across the U.S. have established chapters.
The U.S. Supreme Court slapped down the lower courts’ blocking of President Trump’s travel ban Monday and ruled that the administration can go ahead with implementing the ban until the court can hear the full case in October.

But there is a caveat to Monday’s ruling as the Court threw open the door to a new set of exceptions to the travel ban.

Any foreign traveler or refugee who can show a “bona fide relationship” with a person or group in the U.S. will be allowed into the country regardless of whether they are traveling from one of Trump’s six designated countries of danger – Iran, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Syria.

Read the entire 16-page Supreme Court decision.

The court’s ruling talks of establishing an “equitable balance” between those American individuals or groups which have a “bonafide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country” and those who don’t. If you are one of these persons or groups with a “relationship” and can prove a concrete hardship if the refugee is excluded, then the lower courts’ block of Trump’s ban continues to apply.

According to Monday’s Supreme Court ruling:

“An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded. As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction. But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government’s compelling need to provide for the Nation’s security. See supra, at 9–11; Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 307 (1981)”

The decision was unanimous. However, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch joined in a separate opinion written by Thomas, who said he agreed with the majority but would have gone further and allowed Trump’s travel ban to be implemented in full, without exceptions.

“I fear that the Court’s remedy will prove unworkable,” Justice Thomas wrote. “Today’s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding —on peril of contempt — whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country.”

Some conservatives immediately hailed the decision. Brigitte Gabriel, founder of ACT! For America, tweeted:

Huge Victory For America and Huge Loss For Anti-American, Open Border Zealots #travelbanlifted @potus @realDonaldTrump — Brigitte Gabriel (@ACTBrigitte) June 26, 2017

Trump himself called it “A clear victory for our national security.”

Others weren’t as upbeat.

What do YOU think? Sound off on the Supreme Court travel restrictions ruling

Ann Corcoran, who has followed the refugee industry closely for the last 10 years and blogs at Refugee Resettlement Watch, said the court has “created a mess” by refusing to come down clearly on one side or the other.

She said immigrant-rights groups will argue, and indeed already are arguing, that nearly every potential refugee has a tie to the U.S. by the mere fact that a resettlement agency in the U.S. is working on their case.

“The courts have created an enormous mess,” Corcoran told WND. “They can go over the 50,000 annual cap for refugees set by President Trump if they can show some bona fide relationship with someone in the U.S. That is insane. You can bet everyone across the country who deals with refugees is hustling now to establish some kind of relationship with a refugee.

“The court is busy trying to ‘balance the equities,’ which means they are basically writing law.”

Corcoran said the Supreme Court is essentially rewriting the Refugee Act of 1980.

“They’ve agree the ceiling is 50,000 but by telling the president he’s allowed to go over the ceiling if they have relatives in the U.S. or have some kind of hardship, they are essentially giving him the power to throw the ceiling out the window,” she said.

Michele Bachmann, former congresswoman from Minnesota and an attorney, also blasted the decision.

“I’m with the Supreme Court dissenters – Gorsuch, Thomas and Alito – on the travel ban case released today. The ‘travel ban’ opinion, like Obamacare legislates from the bench,” Bachmann told WND. “The decision creates nonstop incentives for legal challenges from the immigration industry.”

The Court ignored established U.S. law giving the president plenary authority over immigration, she said.

“That’s inexcusable and a flagrant thumbing of the judicial nose against the rule of law,” Bachmann said. “Instead, the court empowers universities, employers, and immigrant wannabes themselves. Immigrants are empowered to put units of the U.S. government on overworked defense by insisting they have relatives or other contacts in the U.S. The government would have to prove they don’t.”

Bachmann noted the refugee program has already been scammed in the past.

Several years ago the government temporarily shut down Somali resettlements when it was discovered 80 percent of Somali refugees claimed family relationships in the U.S. where none existed. DNA tests proved the family connections were a fraud.

“The faction advancing the unending pipeline of poverty from the Third World is still alive and in business under today’s decision,” Bachmann said.

At a minimum, there will be “many months of chaos” as a result of this decision, Corcoran said. The Supreme Court has agree to hear the full case in October, but it will take two to three months after that to issue a decision.

Nayla Rush, an expert on the refugee program for the Center for Immigration Studies, said he ruling also cast a shadow over the U.S. deal with Australia to take its unwanted refugees.

“That’s a question worth asking: How does this affect the U.S.-Australia refugee deal, knowing that most of Australia’s unwanted refugees are from Iran, Sudan, Somalia etc.? Will Trump give Australia’s refugees detained in offshore processing centers special access into the States despite the travel ban?” she said.

“Instead of a clear positioning, the semi-mitigated decision of the Supreme Court today is setting the pace for further confusion.”

CARSON, Calif. --Baggio Husidic escaped war-torn Yugoslavia as a child in the early-90's long before he was a staple for the LA Galaxy.

The United States' open-door policy to refugees helped the Husidic family prosper in the Chicago area and ultimately helped Baggio become one of the most consistent midfielders in Major League Soccer. The native of Bosnia-Herzegovina is now calling on the U.S. government to act on behalf of Syrian refugees.

Husidic recent spoke with TRT World about the cause in the video above.

An Ohio State University student posted a rant shortly before he plowed a car into a campus crowd and stabbed people with a butcher knife in an ambush that ended when a police officer shot him dead, a law enforcement official said.

Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, wrote on what appears to be his Facebook page that he had reached a "boiling point," made a reference to "lone wolf attacks" and cited radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.

"America! Stop interfering with other countries, especially Muslim Ummah [community]. We are not weak. We are not weak, remember that," the post said.

Two hours before that, a cryptic post on the page said: "Forgive and forget. Love."

Officials cautioned that they have not determined a motive for the ambush, which sent 11 people to the hospital Monday morning. A senior law enforcement official told NBC News that investigators are trying to determine whether Artan had personal problems or something else that might have pushed him over the edge.

A police officer was on the scene within a minute and killed the assailant, likely saving lives, university officials said. "He engaged the suspect and eliminated the threat," OSU Police Chief Craig Stone said.

Law enforcement officials told NBC News that Artan was a Somali refugee who left his homeland with his family in 2007, lived in Pakistan and then came to the United States in 2014 as a legal permanent resident.

He lived briefly in a temporary shelter in Dallas before settling in Ohio, according to records maintained by Catholic Charities.

Artan attended Columbus State Community College for two years, graduating cum laude with an associate's degree before moving on to Ohio State to continue his studies. He told a campus publication that on his first day at OSU, he was "kind of scared" to pray in public.

"If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don't know what they're going to think, what's going to happen," Artan was quoted as saying in the Lantern.

The violence unfolded just before 10 a.m. ET Monday near an academic hall on the Columbus, Ohio, campus, where 60,000 students are enrolled.

Officials said Artan drove onto campus by himself and rammed the car past the curb and into a crowd on the sidewalk.

"This car just swerved and ran into a whole group of people," said Nicole Kreinbrink, who was walking down the street when she saw the car hit people who had evacuated an academic building during a fire alarm.

"All these people were running and screaming and yelling," she added.

Jacob Bowers, an OSU sophomore, was sitting on a bench about 100 feet away when he noticed people running.

"Then I heard someone yell, 'He's got a knife.' And I saw a guy with a big-ass knife just chasing people around. When I saw that, I grabbed all my stuff and started running," Bowers said.

Bowers said he looked back to see a police officer on the scene. The officer yelled to the suspect, "Drop it and get down, or I'll shoot," and then fired on the suspect, Bowers said.

"The man was going insane," he said.

Another student told NBC News that he heard gunfire from his dorm room.

"I heard gunshots from my dorm, probably six or seven," said Stephen Yunker, 18, a freshman who lives two blocks from Watts Hall, where the incident occurred.

He said he and his roommate looked at each other, heard sirens about five seconds later, and then looked out the window.

"We saw fire trucks, couple of cars and a body laying on the ground," he said.

OSU police identified the officer who took down Artan as Alan Harujko, who has been on the force for two years.

The campus was put on lockdown for 90 minutes after the university first reported an "active shooter" in the chaos of the moment.

"Run Hide Fight," the university's emergency management office tweeted. "Continue to shelter in place."

Students hunkered down in classrooms with shades drawn across the 2,000-acre campus.

Lisa Goldstein, 26, was in her Geographical Information Systems class in Stillman Hall when a text alert hit everyone's phones. The students blocked the door with their book bags and monitored social media and live streams for updates.

"It's a little overwhelming and scary. It's not something you think would happen on our campus," she told NBC News.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich praised law enforcement for stopping Artan before he could do more harm.

"Think about what this tragedy could have meant, a man with a butcher knife and who knows what else?" he said.

President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack, a White House spokesman said. The FBI is assisting in the investigation.

Hassan Omar, president of the Somali Community Association of Ohio, told NBC News that reports that the attacker was Somali were upsetting.

"Every Somali person has been calling me, and everybody is crying," he said.

"This is a shock," he added. "As a Somali community here, we are in a state of shock. In Columbus, we live in a very peaceful community. This is going to affect the life of everybody. We are American, and we don't want somebody to create this problem."
A fourteen-year-old Canadian girl has been sexually assaulted by a Syrian migrant.

It was supposed to be a night of innocent fun and giddy excitement — her first high school dance — but for one girl at New Brunswick’s Fredericton High School, the night would go on to haunt her well after the last song was played.

The young girl’s mother (who asked that she and her daughter have their identities protected) reached out to TheRebel.Media.

She told us that her daughter was approached by two Syrian migrants who are enrolled at the Canadian high school. Both attempted to grind with the fourteen-year-old girl before one of the migrant students came up behind her, and aggressively touched her — her body and her breasts — before forcing his hand down her pants, touching her vagina from inside her underwear.

Through emails and a recorded phone interview, the Fredricton mother told me that, at first, Fredricton High School belittled reports of the sex assault against her daughter, and was told to consider things from the Syrian migrant’s perspective — to consider how western girls’ clothing has the potential to create cultural tension.

The girl’s mother informed me that the the police were aware of the sex assault and that she had hoped to press charges; however, following a questionable interaction between the young girl and one detective, there is now no sign that charges will be pressed.

According to the girl’s mother, the Syrian migrant student was suspended for just one week and is now back at school — with her daughter. Meantime, the 14-year-old girl has missed several weeks worth of school and is now seeing a mental health professional to help her cope with the trauma.

And it would seem this young girl isn't alone. Her mother told me that there have been complaints from other girls, too. More reports of “Syrian boys groping and touching girls’ breasts and trying to touch girls’ vaginas at previous school dances.”

She also told me that the much older Syrian students at FHS are permitted to attend school dances, which she describes as “unfair to the younger students.” But, for reasons unclear to her, the issues — despite being well known — are not being reported.

Now, Rebel Media sought to verify the sex assault allegations before presenting this young girl’s story to you. And so, we followed up with the school. We filed an access to information request. We informed Fredricton High School of our tip and asked that they provide any information regarding the alleged sexual assault in question.

We received shy of one dozen pages of email transactions between teachers and school administrators, all of which authenticated our source’s story.

Over the course of the past eight months, I have presented a dozen reports, based on over three thousand pages of documents, covering five different Canadian provinces on the topic of Syrian students abusing their peers.

In our ongoing investigation into allegations of abuse and sexual harassment perpetrated by Syrian migrant students on Canadian children, these stories out of FHS were some of the most disturbing. Some two-thousand and seven hundred pages of email transactions between teachers, administrators, and school board members painted a picture of ongoing physical abuse and sexual harassment within their walls:

Syrian men in their twenties enrolled in the high school, successfully hitting on the much younger girls; requests for gender segregation and prayer spaces; expressions of excitement over the Brussels bombings and hobbies that included rocket propelled grenades.

It’s happening. There’s evidence, evidence that we here at TheRebel.Media have made publicly available. Every page of every Access to Information request we’ve filed is posted in full on our website.

And yet, there is a country-wide cone of silence on the subject.

And, if you or someone you know has a story of their own, send us a note at tips@therebel.media. We'll look into your claim and, if it's true, we'll tell your story.

Because, unlike the mainstream media, we here at The Rebel won't ignore the young girls and boys who are ultimately being affected by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's sloppy Syrian refugee policy.
When President Trump announced in Iowa last week that he planned to ask Congress for a tightening of restrictions on welfare use by immigrants—barring their use of welfare for 5 years—I wondered if he would wander in to the minefield of refugee welfare use.

Readers here know that refugees use social services/welfare immediately (within weeks) upon arrival and that the primary job of their resettlement contractor*** is to get them signed up for their services ASAP.

Here is Trump in Iowa last Wednesday:

“The time has come for new immigration rules that say … those seeking immigration into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years,” Trump said.

My ears pricked up and I wondered if he means refugees too. If he does, he can expect wailing and moaning on the level he received when he announced his original travel ban.

(See here that refugees are exempt from the Clinton-era restrictions on welfare use by immigrants.)

If Trump persuades Congress to disallow welfare for 5 years for all classes of immigrants that would certainly be a backdoor way to rein-in the US Refugee Admissions Program. Maybe, just maybe, the mostly ‘religious’ resettlement contractors*** would have to raise private charitable money or cut the number of the ‘clients’ they ‘care for.’ And, heck, maybe those meatpackers would have to go to paying higher wages as refugee families now use welfare as a back-up for low-wage earnings.

But, don’t hold your breath!

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

As Americans, we have a long tradition of helping refugees who, through no fault of their own, are fleeing war and persecution and wish to become contributing members of our society. It’s a moral calling and one of the things that makes our country great. However, the most important factor when it comes to America’s refugee program is ensuring the safety and security of the American people. There are already documented cases of terrorists infiltrating the program, and with ISIS vowing to exploit it further, the time for congressional action is now.

This week, the House Judiciary Committee began considering legislation we introduced to fix our broken refugee program. Our bill implements stronger vetting, gives states and communities the power to decline resettlement, and lowers the annual refugee ceiling to the number recommended by President Trump. It’s a smart bill that is worthy of bipartisan support.

To be clear, we support America’s refugee program. But it needs to be modernized to keep pace with the security challenges of today’s world.

According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, more than 300 people who came to the United States as refugees are under active terror-related investigations by the FBI. Several refugees have already been arrested on federal terrorism charges. For example, two Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States in 2009 — Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan — confessed to using improvised explosive devices against U.S. soldiers in Iraq and sending weapons and money to al Qaeda in Iraq for the purpose of killing American soldiers. Last year, two refugees from Iraq — Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan and Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab — were arrested for attempting to provide material support to ISIS and for lying to U.S. immigration officials about their alleged ties to terrorist organizations. This is a serious failure of the government’s most important responsibility — keeping the American people safe.

Under current law the American people have little say about the refugee program since their elected representatives have little authority over the number of refugees admitted into the country, or where they are resettled.

When concerns about the lack of vetting for Syrian refugees erupted in 2015, over half of America’s governors opposed letting them into their states. This opposition tracked with the American people, as poll after poll showed a majority had concerns about accepting Syrian refugees. Resettlement continues despite their concerns.

Our Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act fixes these problems. The bill enhances the integrity of the refugee program, curbs fraud and protects national security. Notably, it requires the implementation of a fraudulent document detection program and the creation of a searchable database of scanned documents. It also requires federal immigration officers to review publicly available internet postings, including social media, for each applicant.

The bill creates a second line of defense once the refugee is admitted by allowing regular security vetting of each admitted refugee until they change their immigration status. It also requires the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to report on the security of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, the number of refugees convicted of terrorism-related offenses, and the use of federally funded benefit programs.

Our bill empowers the American people by allowing their elected officials to decide whether to resettle refugees in their communities. The Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act reduces the refugee ceiling to 50,000 annually — the number proposed by President Trump — and shifts to Congress authority to change the number. No longer will the president be able to decide unilaterally how many refugees come to the United States, as President Obama repeatedly did. This ensures uniformity, with Congress setting annual limits, as is the case for all other immigration programs with annual limits.

The American people have been — and will always be — compassionate and generous, but we must not allow bad actors to take advantage of that. The Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act makes meaningful reforms to our refugee program, enabling it to meet the security challenges of the 21st century.

When the Supreme Court moved to let the administration enforce part of President Donald Trump’s travel ban, the court was less-than-clear about what that meant for refugees.

The ruling, issued Monday morning, ordered that the government can enforce the travel ban except in the case of people with “bona fide relationships” with American people or entities.

Left unaddressed is what exactly that means from refugees who may have contacts in the US through refugee organizations but little else.

“It could have been an easy day, it could have been a really sad day,” said Melanie Nezer of HIAS, a Jewish organization that does refugee resettlement. “Now it’s just kind of confusing.”

The Daily Beast reached out to spokespersons for the Justice Department, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security and didn’t get clarity from any of them; the State Department released a vague statement to reporters that didn’t mention refugees, and the others didn’t respond.

HIAS is a plaintiff in one of the travel ban cases the Supreme Court will consider in October. And for the time being, they’re hoping the government will take a broad interpretation of what exactly constitutes a “bona fide relationship.”

Nezer noted to The Daily Beast that refugees who go through America’s resettlement process work closely with U.S. government officials and American NGOs before coming to the U.S. American officials screen refugees for health problems and national security threats. And once a refugee has gone through that process, he or she gets connected with an American refugee resettlement agency, like HIAS. That agency lays the groundwork for the refugee to start a new life in the U.S., helping them find a place to live and start the hunt for work.

Nezer and other refugee advocates argue the vetting process means refugees have genuine relationships with an American entity––the government––that should exempt them from the ban.

But that isn’t a consensus view.

David Rivkin, a Constitutional lawyer and former Justice Department official during the George H. W. Bush and Reagan administrations, told The Daily Beast he didn’t think just going through the vetting process would qualify a refugee to be exempt from the ban.

“I would argue that just having been vetted isn't enough of a familial relationship,” he said, “but there will be litigation over this for sure.”

Nezer said she hopes the administration will take a different view.

“Just about everybody, if not everybody, who was allowed in before should still be allowed in,” she said. “Certainly in the refugee program, it’s hard to envision a scenario where they wouldn’t meet that requirement.”

And Becca Heller, who heads the International Refugee Assistance Project––the lead plaintiff in one of the cases the Supreme Court will hear––shares Nezer’s cautious optimism.

“The hope is that this really only impacts a very small number of people,” she told reporters on a call shortly after the court’s order came down.

She added that the court had created “a mildly unworkable and somewhat confusing standard.”

Even though the ruling put them in limbo, things could be worse for impacted refugees. Some advocates worried the court would revert to the much stricter ban that Trump first rolled out. And the court’s three conservatives, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and newly minted Justice Neil Gorsuch, wrote they would have gone farther, reinstating the whole ban.

Instead, there’s just suspense and anxiety as refugee advocates wait to see how hard the Trump administration will fight for a restrictive ban.

And there’s certainly precedent for the Trump administration working energetically to keep out refugees. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House Senior Advisor Stephen Miller were vocal critics of the U.S. refugee resettlement program when Sessions was in the Senate and Miller was an advisor to him there. In a joint letter with Republican Rep. Dave Brat, Sessions wrote that the refugee resettlement program, along with other immigration policies, put Americans at “grave and needless risk.”

It’s unclear if members of the administration deciding how to move forward share that concern. And in the meantime, refugees have to wait and see.
The Washington Examiner points out data released Friday showing a significant drop in refugee admissions in the first calendar quarter of the Trump administration.

*Worth noting that Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, UAE, Jordan and Oman have also initiated an “immigration ban” as part of the political sanctions against Qatar.

WASHINGTON – Data released Friday by the Department of Homeland Security shows that the number of refugees allowed into the United States fell by half shortly after President Trump took office. The decline was in large part due to a sharp upsurge in admissions under former President Barack Obama in the final three months of his administration.

DHS reported that approximately 13,000 people were admitted as refugees during the first three months of Trump’s administration, compared with 25,000 for the previous quarter. However, the 25,000 refugees were an 86 percent increase over the same period in 2015, indicating that Obama significantly eased restrictions as his administration was winding down. Had the admissions rated remained flat in the final three months of the Obama administration, the decline under the Trump would have been a mere 12 percent, the department said. The majority of the refugees came from Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Myanmar and the Congo. Trump attempted to ban all refugees from Syria and Somalia through executive orders but courts have declared the orders unconstitutional. (read more)

Refugees

People from around the world are forced to leave the countries they call home because it is no longer safe for them to stay. Join the community of people who are opening their homes for free to refugees.
There is more poverty in the world than we realize. And, we are all in it together.
Donald Trump’s attempt to stop letting citizens from six (originally seven) majority-Muslim countries into the US was one of his first moves as president, and it ran into repeated legal challenges. Today, in a 16-page opinion, the Supreme Court said it would hear the case for the ban later this year. Meanwhile, it’s allowing the government to implement it—but with caveats that have some observers scratching their heads.

The court said only people without a “bona fide relationship with a person or entity” in the US can be barred. But it was somewhat vague about what a bona fide relationship is. It did give some examples: people with relatives in the US or foreign students admitted to a US university are bona fide, while an immigration non-profit can’t add foreigners as clients in order for them to elude the ban. But it’s not clear what it means for, say, asylum seekers who had existing relationships with such organizations.

“I predict chaos at the border and new lawsuits as foreign nationals and refugees argue that they are entitled to enter the United States,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University Law School professor, in an emailed statement.

Trump, who last week ordered that the ban be put in place within 72 hours if it was ever unblocked, called the court’s decision “a clear victory for our national security.” In fact it’s anything but clear: Under the court’s terms, for instance, legitimate asylum seekers with no ties in the US can be barred, while potential terrorists who do have ties could get in—assuming they can hide their terrorist connections, something that existing screening already looks for. Indeed, three of the nine justices on the court dissented, arguing that the court should have allowed the ban to proceed in full.

A moot issue?

Finally, there’s the question of why the court has agreed to hear the case at all. The travel ban was originally supposed to be for 90 days only, ostensibly to give the administration time to review vetting policies for travelers. (Why it hasn’t been able to review them in the five months since it first announced the ban is another question.) If the ban is put in place on June 29, those 90 days will be up before the Supreme Court meets in October. At which point the ban will, in theory, no longer be needed anyway.

Why, then, would the justices agree to take the case? One key reason is that it’s so controversial and of such public concern that they couldn’t ignore it, said Jennifer Gordon, a professor at Fordham Law School. Whether the justices decide to definitively answer the complicated legal questions the ban raises is a separate issue.

It’s unclear what the court will ultimately make the case about when it hears it. It could focus on the findings of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which argued that the constitution bars Trump from implementing the ban. Or it could look at the arguments of the Ninth Circuit Court, which found it was US immigration laws that prohibited the policy. Or it could sidestep both by determining the case is moot, says Gordon.

Later that year, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, submerging communities once believed to be safe behind levees and dikes. As floodwaters inundated Vietnam’s Mekong Delta last year, Geisler’s new worldview came into sharp relief. The rising sea, he surmised, is the one displacement force more powerful than greed. Geisler began collating climate and demographic research, and came to a dire conclusion: By the year 2100, rising sea levels could force up to 2 billion people inland, creating a refugee crisis among one-fifth of the world’s population. Worse yet, there won’t be many places for those migrants to go. His findings appear in the July issue of the journal Land Use Policy. “We have a pending crisis,” Geisler, a professor emeritus of development sociology at Cornell, told HuffPost. “This relocation and huge mass migration from the coastal zone, it’s going to take place in this century and the next century.”

To get the 2 billion figure, Geisler extrapolated from a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS One. That research predicted that by 2060, there would be some 1.4 billion people living in low-lying coastal regions at risk from sea level rise. Drawing from nearly a dozen other studies, Geisler and his co-author, the University of Kentucky climate researcher Ben Currens, modeled what he called a “rather extreme scenario.” “The paper is the worst-case scenario,” Geisler said. “We looked for estimates in these various barriers to entry that were coming from the most draconian changes that could hit us from climate change and sea level rise.” Geisler outlined three obstacles, or “barriers to entry,” to relocating people driven inland from their homes by rising seas. The first problem is that climate change isn’t just affecting coastal communities. Droughts and desertification could make areas safe from sea level rise uninhabitable at worst, and incapable of sustaining a large influx of migrants at best, Geisler said. The second issue is closely linked: If climate refugees flock to cities, increasing the urban sprawl into land once used to farm food, those metropoles could lose the ability to feed their inflated populations. The third issue involves physical and legal barriers, meaning regions and municipalities might erect walls and post guards to prevent climate migrants from entering and settling down. Geisler dubbed this phenomenon the “no-trespass zone.” Geisler warned that too much of the conversation around climate adaptation is focused on building sea walls, learning to live with regular flooding, and relocating communities inland, as has happened in Alaska. These limited ideas of “adaptation” could leave humanity woefully unprepared for a mass migration that Geisler said could dwarf the current refugee crisis in Europe, driven by war, poverty and drought-linked famine in regions south and east of the continent. At least 65.6 million people have fled their homes, and the United Nations estimates that 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute by war and persecution alone. Adding unfettered climate change to that mix threatens to yield human catastrophe on a scale that is difficult to describe without sounding bombastic. The U.S. is particularly at risk. Millions of mainland Americans could be forced to flee inland, sending the populations of at least nine coastal states downward, according a University of Georgia study released in April. Texas alone could have to take in as many as 2.5 million internal migrants.

The rising sea, he surmised, is the one displacement force more powerful than greed.

It has now been almost two years since the world was confronted with the harrowing image of drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish beach. At that moment, there was an overwhelming sense of “Enough is enough” — a cry of anguish over the misery endured and lives snuffed out as refugees seek safety. In the time since then, thousands more have lost their lives while trying to traverse the Mediterranean, with 2016 becoming the deadliest year on record. Globally, refugees now number more than 22 million.

Yet the sad truth is that for many, especially in the prosperous Global North, refugees have slipped from the minds of citizens. When they do appear, it’s often because of irresponsible political rhetoric designed to stoke fears rather than foster genuine debate. Citizens of countries witnessing an influx of refugees sometimes feel overwhelmed, concerned that borders are no longer secure and that their jobs and way of life are under threat. Quasi-populist politicians have all too often exploited these fears — when what is needed is responsible leadership shaped by facts, principles and values.

But around the world, the plight of the uprooted is also driving thousands of acts of solidarity, from the Ugandan farmers sharing their land with refugees fleeing famine and violence in South Sudan to the Canadian communities offering a lifeline through sponsored resettlement programs to the teachers, employers, athletes, faith groups and volunteers working to foster the inclusion of refugees in the social, economic and cultural lives of their communities. It is their voices — the voices of compassion and humanity that often struggle to make themselves heard — that should guide our call for action this World Refugee Day.

Today is an opportunity to appeal to what Abraham Lincoln called the “ better angels of our nature .” We need leaders to act responsibly and commit to cooperating and sharing the burden, so the world can manage refugees with dignity and respect their human rights.

At the moment, the balance is skewed. Most pressure has fallen on neighboring states. Tiny Lebanon , for example, hosts more refugees (1,462,926) than the total number of asylum seekers that arrived in the European Union in 2015, when numbers peaked (1,255,600). This is not an isolated case. Eighty-four percent of refugees are in developing countries, while the countries that account for 57% of global GDP host fewer than 9% of all refugees and asylum seekers .

One of the most important forms of burden-sharing is resettlement, through which refugees find security and stability in a third country. The United Nations’ refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates that 1.2 million especially vulnerable refugees are in need of resettlement in 2017, but places are expected to be available for fewer than one in ten — a drop of around 43% from 2016. Traditionally, the United States has been UNHCR’s largest resettlement partner, but the Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump in January has sought to more than halve the number of refugees that can be settled in the U.S. this year.

Curtailing the U.S. resettlement program — the last lifeline to so many — is deeply regrettable. It undermines the great values of a nation that has always championed humanitarian principles and human rights.

But as long as an isolationist mood prevails in Washington, D.C., other powers have an even greater responsibility to uphold the values and mechanisms of refugee protection — especially the European Union, given the continuing tragic deaths on the shores and waters of the Mediterranean.

In 2015, many European citizens showed great acts of solidarity and humanity to the influx of refugees. Some European governments took courageous steps, particularly Germany. Yet certain other European states — and in certain respects, the institutions of the European Union — have so far seemed more interested in closing borders and deflecting responsibility elsewhere than championing compassion. Tens of thousands of refugees remain stranded in Greece, some in truly pitiful conditions. Meanwhile, a 2015 E.U. agreement to share responsibility by relocating refugees within Europe remains largely unimplemented.

No one underestimates the challenges of devising a fair and robust shared refugee policy or of balancing humanitarian imperatives with fraught domestic political agendas. Nevertheless, there is a clear need for moral leadership from the E.U., an institution created amidst the rubble of post-war Europe with solidarity at its core.

The current negotiations on an E.U. Resettlement Framework present an opportunity for precisely this leadership. It is imperative that this framework increases the quantity and quality of resettlement places available, without making this conditional upon third country cooperation with the E.U. on migration controls. The March 2016 E.U.-Turkey deal, for example, offered resettlement of Syrian refugees from Turkey, but only in exchange for the forcible return of those arriving on Greek shores. The lives of the world’s most vulnerable refugees cannot be allowed to become a political bargaining chip.

In his poem “ No Man Is An Island ,” the English poet John Donne wrote that “Any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.” His words ring true today, some four centuries later. They should guide our global efforts to treat refugees with the respect and dignity they deserve.
The Legal Services Society of B.C. will stop paying lawyers to represent refugees as of Aug. 1 because it has run out of money and has not received promised funding from Ottawa to deal with the fallout from a global humanitarian crisis.

The non-profit legal aid organization handled 860 refugee contracts in 2016-17, compared to 350 in 2013-14, and it expects to accept around 1,400 of 1,900 applications this year.

Ontario, which has 10 times the volume of cases, and other provincial legal aid plans are facing a similar crisis, which may be slowing federal funds, said Mark Benton, CEO of the society.

“We knew at the start of the year that this was going to be a problem,” he explained Monday. “I think, in part, circumstances have exceeded the federal government’s planning. They announced this year a 20-per-cent increase for immigration refugee legal aid, but as you can see over the last three years we needed a 145-per-cent increase to cover the costs.”

Refugees are the society’s smallest service area, but its most vulnerable clients. About half are refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey; another one-quarter come from Central and South America.

“These are not Trump refugees,” Benton stressed. “They are from places where you are at a real risk of persecution because of your political beliefs or cultural background. This is a national issue about Canada being seen as a safe haven by real people in need. We are seen as a country that welcomes people.”

Ottawa is responsible for immigration and refugee laws, including immigration tribunals, their processes, and immigration-and-refugee legal aid.

“It will have a huge impact,” complained Chris Friesen, a director of the Immigrant Services Society of B.C. in Vancouver. “The complexity of the asylum system in Canada really requires refugees have access to legal aid. I understand it’s money, but to unilaterally stop it outright really penalizes the very people you want to ensure have a fair hearing and are not put at further risk because they were not able to articulate the reasons for their asylum claim.”

He predicted lengthier hearing, delays in the asylum process and legal appeals on the grounds these individuals were not adequately prepared to represent themselves.

The federal government gives Victoria $900,000 annually for legal aid for immigrants, which the province passes on to the Legal Services Society of B.C. along with an additional $800,000, for a total of $1.7 million.

Last year, in response to the increasing demand, the federal government stepped up with an additional $530,000. Even with that, though, the society had to restrict services, Benton said.

Based on current projections, the society estimates an additional $1.07 million is needed to maintain services until year end.

“In the past, the federal government has responded and provided the additional funding,” Benton acknowledged. “But part of the problem this time is Ontario in particular has seen a huge volume — they are about $13 million in the hole.”

The Legal Services Society must stop issuing new contracts to ensure it has enough money to pay for contracts already issued, he said, because the province prohibits it from incurring a deficit or from reallocating funding from other services to cover immigration and refugee costs.

Cases that are approved before Aug. 1 will not be affected, but must be concluded by the end of the fiscal year (March 31, 2018).

Cases in which a client has applied before the deadline but not yet been approved will be processed.

“We screen these cases — these aren’t just people who show up and want to extend their time in Canada,” Benton emphasized.

“They are genuine refugee cases. These folks typically are coming from a place where they feel persecution. What they are facing is somebody else’s legal system — ours — they’re not familiar with it, often they don’t speak English or not very much English, they have low levels of literacy, they need representation just to have a fair hearing. With this particular group of clients, they are extraordinarily marginalized and highly vulnerable to the smallest errors in process.”

The test for referral to a lawyer is whether a person of modest means would pay privately for the case given the ultimate chance of success and the risk the person faces in his or her country of origin.

Lawyers earn about $1,950 for a typical case. The average annual earnings from immigration cases are about $17,300 per lawyer.

As refugee claimants cannot effectively represent themselves, providing them with representation creates efficiencies for the Immigration and Refugee Board, Benton noted.

An increase in self-represented refugees will result in longer proceedings and require hearing officers to take a more active role in ensuring the claim is properly heard.

Providing legal representation also takes a burden off immigrant services agencies and other community resources that will be needed to assist an increased number of unrepresented claimants.

The Legal Services Society also funds duty counsel who provide advice to people held in custody at the Canada Border Services’ Vancouver enforcement centre. That service will not be affected.

Benton said the society will reinstate services if additional funding is received or at the beginning of the 2018-19 fiscal year (April 1, 2018).

The federal government did not respond to requests for comment by publication deadline.

The number of refugees coming into the U.S. was cut nearly in half in the first three months of the Trump administration compared to the final months of the Obama administration, according to data released Friday.

Data released by the Department of Homeland Security showed 13,000 refugees entering the U.S. during the first three months of Trump’s presidency, compared to the 25,000 admitted at the end of the Obama administration.

The number of refugees admitted in the final months before President Trump entered office was a major increase – up 86 percent – compared to the previous year.

Meanwhile, the number of arrivals admitted in the initial months of the Trump administration was down 12 percent compared to the same period last year.

The nationalities of refugees entering the U.S. during both administrations did not change. Two thirds of refugees came from Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Myanmar the Dominican Republic and the Congo.

The number of arrivals coming from Syria and Somalia would have been much lower if federal courts allowed Trump’s proposed travel ban.

Trump has pushed to take a hardline stance on allowing refugees into the U.S. The president is looking to limit the number of refugees coming into the U.S. to 50,000 in 2017.

Washington, DC - Refugee advocacy groups have raised concerns after the US Supreme Court partially reinstated the Trump administration's ban on travellers from six predominantly Muslim countries - commonly known as the "Muslim ban" - and all refugees, until it reviews the policy in October.

"I am deeply disappointed by the court’s decision … the suspension of refugee resettlement will impact the most vulnerable of the world's populations," Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International, said in a statement sent to Al Jazeera.

US President Donald Trump claims the order, originally signed in March after a similar ban was struck down in February, is necessary for the US to revamp its screening protocols for refugees. He said the decision was a "clear victory" for national security in a statement on Monday.

OPINION: The Muslim ban and the ethnic cleansing of America

Schwartz disagreed: "There is no reasonable national security justification for these measures." According to reports, no refugees have been responsible for fatal attacks in the US since the Refugee Act of 1980 set up systematic procedures for accepting refugees into the country.

The ban takes effect 72 hours after the injunction is lifted - Thursday morning in the US. It places a 90-day freeze on visas to travellers from Syria, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen - as well as a 120-day freeze on the nation's refugee programme.

The court made an important exception, saying the ban "may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States".

Proving 'bon fides'

The exception granted to those with "bona fide" relationships means that refugees and travellers should have familial, work or education connections to the US, such as a spouse, job offer or acceptance at a domestic university.

Betsy Fisher, lawyer and policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), a party named in one of the cases against the ban, told Al Jazeera that the extent to which the reinstatement will affect refugees remains to be seen.

"I think a lot of it will depend on how the phrase 'bona fide relationship to the US' will be determined," Fisher said. The relationship exception was made because the challenges to the ban came from individuals and organisations whose families and employees would be affected.

Asylum seekers from Iraq often have familial relationships or a work history with the US military, said Fisher. According to the US Census, there are more than 215,000 people of Iraqi ancestry living in the country as of 2015. Thousands received visas through the Special Immigrant Visa programme, created specifically for Iraqis who had assisted the US since it invaded the country in 2003.

This means Iraqi refugees could more easily prove their bona fides compared with Syrians or Sudanese. Individuals from these nations have smaller US populations - 82,681 and 46,037, respectively - and no similar visa programmes, Fisher observed.



The burden of bona fide tests could "prove unworkable", according to the partial dissenting opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Consular officials must now decide, "on peril of contempt", whether people from the banned nations have a sufficient connection to persons or entities in the US, and face a "flood of litigation" from those denied, Thomas said.

Akila Radhakrishnan, vice-president and legal director of the Global Justice Center, a New York-based group that works for gender equality and protection of vulnerable groups, told Al Jazeera in an interview the ban's reinstatement was a "serious issue" for endangered minorities in all six of the nations included on the ban, owing to their limited connections to the US.

Religious minorities such as the Yazidis, the majority of whom live in Iraq but are also found in Syria and Iran, are an example. The sect is insular, keeping marriages and other relationships within their own communities. Estimates place their US population in the low thousands and they are predominately found in one city in Nebraska.

OPINION: How the Muslim Ban incites vigilante Islamophobic violence

Rather than coming through a temporary non-immigrant visa - as Iraqis are entitled to after having their nation removed from the original ban - these and other vulnerable populations would be likely to travel to the US as asylum seekers.

"By limiting it to bona fide … you're limiting the scope of the protections" given to refugees by international law, Radhakrishnan said. Even those from larger groups in Iraq and other nations aren't guaranteed to meet the “bona fide” standard, she explained.

Radhakrishnan argues that the ban's reinstatement also costs the US status in the international community, as it is a "policy based on racism and xenophobia".

In spite of the court's decision, groups such as IRAP and the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it was confident the ban will be struck down "once and for all" come October, vowed to continue advocating for those in need.

IRAP's Fisher said "a lot remains to be seen", but they "look forward to the decision in October".

What comes to your mind when hear the term “refugee”? Refugee issue has been a hot topic

throughout the world, as President Trump issued Executive Order in the US and as the major

elections are taking place in Europe around this issue. Where does Japan stand in the international community on this issue? It has been under criticism as the number of refugee acceptance in Japan has been dismal, around 30 or so a year, out of over 10,000 applications.

At session #49 of Davos Experience in Tokyo, we will have Riyo Yoshioka, of Human Rights Watch

Japan office and Sayaka Watanabe, founder of NPO WELGEE (Welcome Refugee). We will hear

the status of refugees in Japan and think about what we can do about the issue of refugees, and more broadly human rights violation beyond refugee.

A plane chartered by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection has left the Australian territory early yesterday with about 20 people — some of them guards and interpreters — onboard, The Australian reported..

The Sri Lankan nationals were led up the steps of the plane with a guard on each side.

The return of Sri Lankans from Christmas Island to Colombo overnight on a government charter jet has fuelled speculation that Australian Border Force has inter­cepted a suspected asylum vessel in the past week.

Christmas Island residents yesterday linked the deportations to an unusual spectacle last Thursday when two of the navy’s rigid inflatable vessels were seen towing a small boat close to the horizon.

The last known intercept of an asylum vessel on its way to Australia was in March.

The March monthly update on the department’s website stated: “During this period, Australian authorities worked with the government of Sri Lanka to return 25 people who were detected and intercepted attempting to reach Australia ­illegally by boat, in accordance with Australia’s protection obligations.’’

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton yesterday declined to confirm any new intercept.

The Sri Lankan government has been willing for some years to swiftly take back failed asylum-seekers stopped en route to Australia.

During the sustained wave of boats between 2008 and 2013, Christmas Island sometimes held more than 6000 immigration detainees.

It now operates one detention centre with fewer than 1000 men, but many of them are not asylum-seekers. Instead, the centre has become a place to hold mostly men who are citizens of other countries and have committed crimes while ­living in Australia. Once their jail term ends, they are transferred to immigration ­detention to await deportation.
A survey conducted by Pew Research Center shows that the 1.3 million asylum seekers that entered Europe in 2015 are overwhelmingly male– not widows and orphans as President Barack Obama claimed last year.

Pew’s research shows that four out of 10 refugees in Europe are young men, aged 18 to 34. Approximately three-fourths (73 percent) of refugees entering Europe in total were male, while 53 percent of all refugees were young adults between the ages of 18 and 34. Individuals hailing from war-torn countries making up a large portion of all refugees were also overwhelmingly male. Syrian refugees were 71 percent male, Iraqi refugees were slightly higher at 75 percent, while Afghan refugees were a remarkable 80 percent male. Refugees from these three countries made up over half of Europe’s refugees in 2015.

Research found that young male refugees make up a large portion of asylum applicants in certain countries. Italy’s applicants were heavily young and male, at 74 percent. Germany, which fell victim to a spat of terror attacks committed by refugees last month, saw 39 percent of asylum applications come from young men. Germany has seen the most applications for resettlement, with 442,000– or 33 percent of all applications in Europe.

The European Union has attempted to disperse refugees evenly across its member states, though Pew’s research shows that the endeavor has largely failed. Eighty-four percent of Syrian refugees traveling to Europe applied for asylum in Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands. The E.U. plans to fine member countries an astronomical $280,000 for each refugee a member country refuses to accept as part of the plan.

Obama lambasted Republican politicians who opposed allowing Syrian refugees into the U.S. after the Paris attacks last November, claiming they were “scared of widows and orphans.” He also accused several former Republican presidential candidates of engaging in rhetoric that serves as a “potent recruitment tool” for the Islamic State.

Australia's 'Offshore Processing' refugee policy has left nearly 2000 people in indefinite limbo and harsh conditions on the Pacific Islands of Manus (PNG) and Nauru, for more than 3 years now.





‘Gifts for Manus and Nauru' is a registered charity supporting our asylum seeker and refugee friends at Manus and Nauru through sending parcels of much needed items and through the provision of mobile phone credit.



Communication in the camps is very limited, making regular access to calls home to family and to other supports difficult. Mobile Phone credit provides vital support for physical and mental health by allowing contact with family, as well as allowing access to medical, legal, media and advocacy support in Australia, and contact with supportive friends who offer much needed emotional support and connection.



Gifts for Manus and Nauru currently sends gifts of phone credit to last a month at a time to approx. 1250 of the people held in Australia's Offshore Processing Blacksites at Manus and Nauru.



The waiting list for people needing credit is often long, with sometimes wait times of several weeks or more between when their month of credit runs out and when they receive their next top up.



We desperately need your help to send more top ups and reduce the time people have to wait between speaking to their family and other supports.



Phone credit costs $30-35 per person for a month. Any contribution you can make will be very welcome and make a big difference to the people held at Manus and Nauru and their loved ones.





Gifts for Manus and Nauru Incorporated is registered as a charity with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.

The deadliest conflict of our time has left 8.4 million children needing emergency aid. Syrian children have lost their homes, their security, their childhood. UNICEF is urgently appealing for funds to deliver emergency supplies, protection and support to millions of children caught in the line of fire and living on the move as refugees.

More than six years of conflict in Syria has caused one of the largest humanitarian crises since World War 2.



Children within Syria face grave threats to their life and the constant struggle for food, clean water and health care. Millions more have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, where they are desperately trying to rebuild their lives in refugee camps. And every one of these children needs a safe space to learn and build the future they deserve.



The future of an entire generation is at stake.



UNICEF is working to reach as many children as we can, wherever we are needed most, as quickly as possible. For too many children, time is simply running out.
If the risk of a “lost generation” of Syrian students and academics is to be avoided, universities in the region must be part of the solution.

But these institutions – in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey – lack the capacity to deal with the scale of the refugee crisis and, in any case, often face problems of their own.

The ideal of “trying to solve the problem in the region” is “impossible”, said Marcello Scalisi, executive director of the Mediterranean Universities Union (Unimed), an association of 98 institutions based around the shores of the inner sea. Meanwhile, he added, “the position of European countries about refugees is quite confused”.

Unimed already facilitates European universities in integrating refugees from anywhere in the world through the inHERE programme. But this year has also seen the launch of another project, RESCUE (Refugees Education Support in MENA Countries), to open local universities up to Syrians who are now based in Jordan and Lebanon – as well as to displaced Iraqis in Kurdistan. The initiative forms part of the European Commission’s Erasmus+ programme devoted to “capacity-building in the field of higher education”.

“Many refugee students had to leave Syria and would like to resume their studies,” explained Raniero Chelli, senior project manager. “Sometimes they don’t have papers or the hosting countries have regulations that put constraints on enrolling foreign students.” To address this, Unimed brought together several European universities (as required by such Erasmus+ projects) – Sapienza University of Rome, the University of Barcelona, the Technical University of Berlin and Istanbul Aydin University – and then found local partners, either through their network or through the Association of Arab Universities.

Each local institution is setting up a refugee student operational support unit, said Mr Chelli, “a law office of people trained to deliver services to help them resume their university careers”. Although details vary, all will deliver “psychological support for people who have been traumatised” as well as English courses. Relevant staff have been identified and are due to receive training or study visits to Europe, so the units should be running by the end of the year.

The Erasmus+ programme is based on a model of “cooperation for development”, which implies, Mr Chelli suggested, that “the European universities are very advanced and know how to help southern universities improve their way of working”.

In reality, they needed to “collaborate on the basis of sharing information and experiences”, he explained, because Lebanese and Jordanian universities would sometimes say: “We have been doing this for years now. We are dealing with [a refugee crisis] on a scale 10 times larger than you are. Perhaps we’ve got as much to teach you.”

A separate Syria Programme was launched by Cara (the Council for At-Risk Academics) in Istanbul last June. The organisation is supporting about 175 refugee Syrian academics who have managed to reach the UK as part of its core fellowship programme. But it is also looking to help the Syrian academics now based in Turkey whose numbers are estimated at about 1,000 by the government.

These scholars face a number of difficulties, according to programme director Kate Robertson. “Their levels of English [and Turkish] make it difficult for them to function in Turkish universities or in the international arena,” she said. They tend to lack “professional connections” and to be inexperienced in research. Meanwhile, Turkish institutions are “very squeezed” in terms of recruitment and are also trying to cope with the political aftermath of last summer’s abortive coup.

To meet these challenges, Cara has brought together groups of UK universities to create blended learning courses in English for academic purposes and academic skills development, which are now being piloted. Even more significantly, it is bringing refugee Syrian academics to the UK for four to eight weeks for research incubation visits, to draw up joint proposals for research projects with individual academics or groups. This will also enable them to register with a partner university so that they can access online resources.

This approach should enable Syrian academics to hone their research skills, often by working in areas of public health, for example, which may well prove useful in post-conflict Syria.

Given that much academic research now inevitably focuses on Syria and refugees, it can only help to incorporate academics with insider knowledge.

Ms Robertson has been “lobbying those who are putting in big research proposals to the [UK’s] Global Challenges Research Fund, for example, to have budget lines that mean that they involve Syrian academics in the research on Syrian populations”.

“For God’s sake, involve Syrians, they can bring enormous knowledge to the table even if they are not perfect researchers,” she said.

A refugee found guilty of child pornography and sexually assaulting minors was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

According to The Calgary Herald, Tanzirul Alam was convicted of 17 offences involving the girls, ages 14 and 15, including sexual assault, sexual contact with a person under 16, luring, making and transmitting child pornography and obstruction.



The obstruction charge came as Alam made hundreds of phone calls while in the Calgary Remand Centre and convinced a victim to lie in court.



Alam had lured victims he met online and then sexually assaulted them on video. Some of the images were then shared on the internet.



EXCLUSIVE: Refugees Fight Canadians with Rocks, Bricks



The 29-year-old from Bangladesh claimed that being tortured by Al-Qaeda-linked terrorists contributed to his actions. He also said blamed the Canadian government for not educating newcomers to Canadian law and predicted that more refugees would be committing similar acts.



“I believe, in a way, I’m a victim of a system that is not perfect,” he said.



Crown prosecutor Donna Spaner called Alam's statement “self-serving” and claimed his warning about refugees was false.



However, as we recently saw in New Brunswick, a Syrian refugee who beat his wife with a hockey stick said officials didn’t inform him of differences in Canadian laws.

The United States has just slammed its doors on the world’s most vulnerable.

On January 27th, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, implementing extreme vetting of refugees who enter the country.

It suspends the entire US refugee program for 120 days as new “extreme vetting” rules are developed, even though America already has the toughest vetting program for refugees in the world.

It halves America’s refugee intake to a maximum of 50,000 annually, with a complete ban on admitting refugees from war-torn Syria.

It stops seven predominantly Muslim nationalities – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen – from even visiting America. This includes dual-nationals, green card holders, and most visa-holders.

As Global Citizens, we know that opposing viewpoints are a vital part of any robust political discussion. We work with all sides of politics to ensure that governments continue play a leading role in ending extreme poverty.

However, there are basic values that weave the fabric of the American Democracy – like not discriminating on the basis of religion and nationality.

This policy crosses that line.

Refugees are the most vulnerable fellow citizens on our planet, fleeing unimaginable horrors of conflict, persecution and disaster.

These are fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters.

We, as global citizens, stand proudly as supporters of refugee communities and vulnerable populations, regardless of religion or national origin.

We must call President Trump out on his actions and ensure that refugees can have place to call home.

How a Tiny Alaska Town Is Leading the Way on Climate Change KIVALINA, Alaska — Dolly’s home is warm and spacious. Snow gear sits by the door. Illustrated Christianity posters are on the walls. A Mario game is being played on the TV. It could be any house in the throes of a Midwestern winter. Until, that is, Dolly serves maktaaq — small strips of frozen bowhead whale skin and blubber. Despite it being late at night, sunlight bounces off the walls. That’s because this is Kivalina, Alaska, some 70 miles above the Arctic Circle and 1,000 miles from Anchorage.

Her husband Reppi, who’s a fireman, hunter, and whaling captain, puts a video on the TV. A snowmobile zips across the snowy ice. A wolf in the distance hears the motor and runs. A rifle is raised, a shot is fired, the wolf staggers, the snowmobile speeds ahead, another shot is fired, and the wolf falls.

That wolf’s hide is slung over a water tank in front of us. Caribou has recently been killed, too, meat which has been fried, roasted, put into soups. This is part of the tundra subsistence that the people of Kivalina have practiced for centuries.

In the weeks ahead, Reppi will have a different hunting target: bowhead whale.

When a whale is caught in Kivalina, everyone rejoices. The whaling captain is celebrated, the elders distribute the meat down to the last morsel, stories of heroism are shared, and people celebrate for days. Catching a whale can feed the community for months and it forecasts good times to come.

But whether Reppi or anyone else in Kivalina can catch one is uncertain — a bowhead hasn’t been caught for more than 20 years. In this small community of around 450 indigenous people in Northwest Alaska, just about everything is uncertain.

Few places in the world have been as rocked by climate change as Kivalina. Temperature increases in Alaska double the US average, Arctic sea ice has dissipated by 50% since 1979, and the state’s glaciers are losing 75 billion tons of ice a year.

The consequences are both sudden and gradual for the people here — powerful storms are sweeping away the community’s coastline and centuries-old cultural practices like whaling are endangered.

Kivalina is experiencing now what millions of people around the world are soon to face — they are climate change refugees.

Within 10 years, the Army Corps of Engineers has said that the barrier island will no longer be a viable place to live — the inhabitants will be forced to move. By 2100, as many as 13 million people living in coastal regions of the US and hundreds of millions more people throughout the world could be displaced by climate change.

Against this daunting backdrop, citizens of Kivalina are emerging as unlikely pioneers, navigating a thicket of logistical challenges to champion their own relocation. Cities and towns in similar positions have garnered headlines for deciding they must move because of climate change. And now the people of Kivalina are showing us what happens next.

If they succeed, then perhaps the term relocation, which for so many indigenous people evokes the trauma of colonialism, can be reclaimed and dignified. Perhaps the uncertain future of climate change can be managed. And perhaps the mass turmoil looming over various parts of the world can be averted.

Everywhere at Once

All around the world, the pressures of climate change are exposing a frightening lack of preparation and political will. Nowhere is this lack of readiness more pronounced than in the field of relocation.

“Even in the short term, in an emergency, we have no idea what we’re doing, and it’s even tougher to think of a gradual displacement,” said Irwin Redlener, a child health and disaster response expert at Columbia University’s Earth Institute.

“There’s just no roadmap to figure this out, it’s a crazy and complex process.”

Irwin Redlener

“A lot of government planning is how are we going to make sure people have food and water and a place to sleep, but that’s really a bare minimum,” Redlener said. “What they’ll need is housing, jobs, schools for the children, a fast expansion of their healthcare systems — this is where it gets uncomfortable for officials. There’s just no roadmap to figure this out, it’s a crazy and complex process.”

In Alaska, relocation is, at least in theory, much more straightforward than it would be for a metropolis like New York or Miami . Kivalina has a small population and the state has plenty of land to resettle them.

Other places around the world do not.

The Maldives, a small string of Pacific islands, is building new islands for people to relocate to when existing islands get submerged at tremendous expense.

In Palau, another small Pacific island, the government created the largest marine reserve in the world to serve two purposes: create a large buffer against waves and attract global investment for inevitable relocation. Leonardo DiCaprio is an investor.

In Mexico City, the ground is sinking as the city’s aquifers get depleted from overuse, drought, overdevelopment, and warming temperatures.

The city of Guangzhou, a multi-trillion dollar powerhouse in China, is being inundated by rising waters and extreme precipitation. In 2016, the city experienced the most rainfall in history and the sewage systems of the poorer and more crowded neighborhoods are already becoming wrecked.

“We still have a window of opportunity to act,” said Alice Thomas, the climate displacement program manager at Refugees International. “We have to do it on a local level, local communities have to be empowered to figure out what they have to do.”

This growing awareness has spurred international groups to think about adaptation more holistically, especially regarding communities most at risk.

Take Action: Stand With Climate Change Refugees

The World Bank has disbursed $358 million in climate adaptation grants, Switzerland and Norway created the Nansen Initiative to begin the process of developing a better framework for adaptation, the UN’s Green Climate Fund has disbursed more than $1.5 billion for environmental programs, and the Paris climate accords created systems to help low-lying countries and indigenous communities adapt.

“There is a big funding gap for adaptation, and a big gap for finance going into mitigation,” said Nicolo Wojewoda, Europe Team Leader for 350.org, an environmental activist group. “There's nothing so far that shows they are putting enough effort into the kind of implementation needed to achieve them.”

But the mere inclusion is pivotal and could represent a change in thinking.

“This is really a race for new technology and deployment,” said Miyuki Hano, a researcher at Stanford and the co-author of a groundbreaking report on managed retreat, the process by which communities and governments work together to leave a location. “For the US at the national level to step back is in some ways a bizarre assertion that we’re OK with being the losers in this race.”

Hano’s report looks at 27 examples of managed retreat covering 1.3 million people in 22 countries. It considers the full spectrum of why a community might want to leave and what role they play in shaping their future.

The US government, for instance, purchased 36,000 homes at high risk of flooding through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program between 1993 and 2011. These properties were converted into open land to shield against future floods. The program had been limited to the most high-risk properties and wasn’t really concerned with what happened after people left their homes.

In Kivalina, what happens after people leave their homes is what their mission is all about.

Failure to Act

Even in Kivalina, where the stakes are so clear, the state has failed to act.

In 2003, state, federal, and village governments identified 31 places in Alaska that face “imminent threats” from climate change. Of these sites, 12 have voted to relocate and three have been deemed in urgent danger — Newtok, Shishmaref, and Kivalina. Yet none of them have successfully relocated.

The lack of action is not necessarily because agencies tasked with helping are failing to do their jobs. Rather, it’s often because they have not developed frameworks and protocols for effectively dealing with the situation.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (or FEMA) is meant to respond to disasters that overwhelm state and local governments — like Hurricane Katrina or Superstorm Sandy.

Kivalina, while it will be uninhabitable in eight years, hasn’t been declared a federal disaster area and cannot access funds made available through this designation. FEMA has begun to reconceive its approach to climate change, but those efforts remain unfinished.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has also begun to adapt to climate change through a climate resilience program that disbursed $1 billion dollars in 2015 to municipalities around the US. Among the recipients was a small island off the coast of New Orleans called the Isle of de Jean Charles that received $48 million to relocate. The community there developed a comprehensive relocation strategy that resembles the work done by Alaskan communities like Kivalina.

Since 1955, the Isle de Jean Charles has lost 98% of its land due to saltwater intrusion, subsidence, and sea level rise.



But that fund has not been replenished — and under the new administration, it seems unlikely that it will be prioritized. Further, Native Americans in Alaska do not live on reservations. They live on what are known as “Alaska Native Corporations,” and this unusual designation blocks them from applying for many HUD grants. Kivalina happens to live on city-owned land, but surrounding territory is owned by NANA, the regional corporation.

The US Department of the Interior, meanwhile, allocated $6.5 million last year to help Alaskan indigenous communities relocate. But that doesn’t even scratch the surface of the financial demands, which are estimated to be around $200 million in Kivalina alone.

Obama toured Alaska the same year of the Isle de Jean Charles grant and called for $400 million additional funding to help communities like Kivalina adapt and relocate. That funding never materialized and is unlikely to under President Trump.

In Alaska, the undeniable effects of climate change means that politicians generally accept it’s happening, but not much action has taken place.

Previously, remote communities in Alaska had to rely on support from the Denali Commission, an underfunded federal agency that’s devoted to helping communities in Alaska threatened by the environment. The commission is developing strategies for dealing with erosion, flooding and permafrost loss, but unless it receives a major boost in funding, it will have little impact.

“Sen. Murkowski acknowledges the impacts of climate change on Alaska’s coastal communities and believes that the federal government should step up its relief role, but she does not want Alaska’s rural communities used merely as political talking points,” the senator’s spokesman Matthew Felling told The Washington Post.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski has also put forward legislation to raise funds for adaptation and relocation efforts. Neither Sen. Murkowski nor Sen. Dan Sullivan returned requests for comment.

Congressman Don Young believes that climate change is happening, but refrains from blaming human activity.

In 2007, former governor Sarah Palin said, "As a result of this warming, coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, retreating sea ice, record forest fires, and other changes are affecting, and will continue to affect, the lifestyles and livelihoods of Alaskans.”

The current governor, Bill Walker, also acknowledges the need to act on climate change, saying that adaptation funds need to be created.

But no fundamental policy changes or adaptation efforts have been made at the state level that would really improve the plight of communities like Kivalina.

The Riddle of Alaska

The state’s ongoing efforts to placate climate change are riddled with conflicts of interest.

Since Alaska earns much of its revenue from the energy sector, the funds that Gov. Walker and Sen. Murkowski call for would be paid for by drilling for more fossil fuels — exactly what has brought Alaska to such a dire place to begin with. This same fundamental problem — sustaining a fossil fuel economy even as climate change intensifies — can be found all across the world.

“Everything in Alaska is at risk.”

Rick Steiner, Oasis Earth.

“Climate change is one of the greatest threats in Alaskan history,” said Rick Steiner of Oasis Earth, an Anchorage-based environmental advocacy group. “It has already changed Alaska dramatically just in the past 40 years. Even if global carbon emissions were to drop to zero, climate change would continue here. Everything in Alaska is at risk — economy, culture, food security, oceans — everything.”

“It’s been truly horrible to see the disconnect between federal and state government policy and the needs of these communities,” he said. “It’s a humanitarian crisis.”

Alaska is essentially a big pot of oil. It has some of the largest and purest reserves in the world. For years, the state government, which does not tax citizens, received around 90% of its revenues from the oil industry, which funded everything from the school system to road repairs. Now falling oil prices are causing major budget cuts.

In recent years, oil companies have sought to drill for oil in the Arctic waters. It’s a faustian bargain if there ever was one — a spill in this area would almost surely mean environmental disaster, yet the successful extraction of oil could secure financial security for years ahead.

By the time Shell Oil abandoned its bid for Arctic oil, the central contradiction of Alaska’s dependence became more clear — the price tag of adapting to climate change will be astronomical for the state.

Without oil money, it has little chance to cope with those costs. But allowing the oil to flow just makes the problem worse.

On almost the opposite end of the US from Kivalina, the streets of Miami are also filling up with water . Unlike Kivalina, however, the city and region have huge tax bases to draw on. As funding from the state and federal government remains elusive, this is buying the city some time.

“I’m a Republican, but this is a nonpartisan job.”

Jim Cason, Coral Gables Mayor

The city, and the broader Miami-Dade county in general, has another thing working in its favor — there’s broad bipartisan support for action.

It’s what happens when climate change goes from being an abstract, planetary event to something that leaves your car stranded in the middle of a flooded street, or winds up depositing an octopus in your basement.

“I’m a Republican, but this is a nonpartisan job,” Jim Cason, the mayor of Coral Gables in Miami-Dade County, told me. “You have to deal with facts, deal with risks and probabilities, you can’t keep putting your head in the sand.”

Climate change is not as politicized in Alaska, either. But until other politicians become as proactive as Cason, advocates, including those within Kivalina, are calling for new approaches.

“The pattern today has been to wait until after the disaster occurs or displacement occurs to think about the need to move people so usually governments are unwilling to be proactive because this is such an incredibly sensitive issue,” said Alice Thomas from Refugees International.

This wait-and-see approach is both dangerous and expensive. Failing to adequately prepare for climate change puts people at risk of injury, disease, and death and leaves infrastructure open to costly damage.

“With Hurricane Katrina [in New Orleans], the levees failed and we got tremendous flooding, but the community before that knew there were plenty of problems happening already,” said Irwin Redlener of Columbia’s Earth Institute.

“There was a continuous rise of sea level, there was coastal erosion at a really ferocious pace, and a process called subsidence — the city of New Orleans is actually sinking,” he said. “[Now] the city is looking down the barrel of an environmental crisis that is essentially inevitable.”

The Land Is Changing

Every so often, news reports tell of a random sinkhole opening up, swallowing a sidewalk, a car, and even homes. Alaska faces a similar risk — more than 80% of it sits on permafrost, which is essentially frozen ground that's been melting in recent years.

Sometimes permafrost is spread evenly across an area, other times it’s jagged.

Infrastructure that sits on uneven layers of permafrost sinks unevenly into the Earth as temperatures rise, causing building foundations, sewage systems, and more to falter and decay. Part of what has stalled the expansion effort for Kivalina is melting permafrost on potential relocation sites.

“Most of the regions with permafrost are really close to the tipping point,” said Scott Rupp, deputy director of the International Arctic Research Center.

This is one problem facing Alaska. But for Kivalina, there are threats above and beyond the subterranean.

The biggest threat comes from the Chukchi Sea, a body of water that runs to Russia, harboring within it the force of hurricanes. In the fall, the sea usually freezes and protects Kivalina from harsh seasonal storms.

But in the last 20 years, the sea has been freezing later than usual, leaving the village dangerously exposed to harsh fall storms.

In October 2015, the average temperature in was Alaska 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit, five degrees above the norm. This temperature spike has been happening for decades and has caused nearly 50% of Arctic sea ice to vanish.

Now storms batter the island, swallowing chunks of land, and causing the shore to erode year after year.

“It’s just getting smaller and smaller and some day there’s just going to be nothing left.”

Alexis Hawley, advocate

“Back in 2004, when everyone first discovered erosion and global warming here, one of the houses at the far end of the island had to be moved because it was hanging half into the ocean, all from erosion,” said Alexis Hawley, a young mother and youth advocate.

“It’s happening before our eyes, and I believe one day Kivalina isn’t going to be here anymore because of global warming,” she said. “It’s just getting smaller and smaller and some day there’s just going to be nothing left.”

This was the turning point for Kivalina, the year that frighteningly illustrated what’s to come.

How Do You Move?

In the past, the sea ice of the Chukchi sea, west of Kivalina, would be frozen solid by October. In the October of 2004, the ice had yet to form and the water’s tide lapped menacingly in the distance.

That’s when the waves came ripping across the exposed sea and crashed into the island’s beach, flooding pathways and homes with water, and pulling away large chunks of land. That year, storms eroded 70 feet from the beach and put the school in imminent danger.

Temporary sea walls of sandbags and other materials were built over the next several years, but they all failed, sometimes in less than a month.

Then in 2007 when another brutal storm trampled the island, causing more than half of Kivalina’s residents to evacuate, the Army Corps of Engineers began a new assessment that resulted in a sea wall of large boulders that cost several million dollars.

The Army Corps also put the federal and state government on notice — Kivalina would be uninhabitable by 2025.

The people of Kivalina are tired of the word “relocation.” They’ve been working on this goal for so long that the word causes fatigue, evoking years of stalled or stifled efforts.

“We’ve been studied to death, trying to relocate, and now we have to abandon the word,” said Colleen Swan, a former Kivalina councilwoman and community activist. “We’ve been going back to square one since the beginning.”

Kivalina has a long history of working through the intricacies of government and developing a framework for self-reliance — knowledge and wisdom that could prove indispensable to communities all around the world.

They first clamored to move more than a century ago when they were forcibly settled here by the federal government. Up to the 1990s, overcrowdedness was the main motivation. Then in 1992, relocation gained a new dimension: climate change. In the early 2000s, the fragility of their land became more clear, and the Army Corps reported that the island was at severe risk. Since then, the community has fought for relocation, eventually with the help of Re-Locate, and they hope to expand from the island as soon as possible — 2025 is the absolute deadline.

“They have done all of the work in terms of the community layout plans and how they want to orchestrate their community,” said Robin Bronen, executive director of the Alaska Institute for Justice and a senior research scientist at the Institute of Arctic Biology. “Alaska is leading the effort on this and people are paying attention, the world has a tremendous amount to learn about this issue and its complexity and difficulty.”

A nearby site for relocation had been selected in 2002, and action plans for how to carry relocation were developed. Since the mid-2000s, however, progress has stalled. Recently, technological, social, and infrastructural innovations have been made that could have impacts around the world.

Take water and sanitation. More than 780 million people around the world do not have access to adequate water and and 2.4 billion do not have access to toilets. Climate change displacement could drive these numbers up.

Over the past few years, Kivalina has begun investing in mobile toilets, urinals, water tanks, and waste processing machines that are entirely self-sufficient, easy to move, and sanitary through a partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Cold Climate Housing Research Center and other groups such as Re-locate , a collective that has been helping Kivalina for the last five years.

Re-Locate participates with Kivalina in the State of Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge and partnered with the City and Tribal Council to build the Kivalina Biochar Reactor, the Arctic’s first relocatable human waste sanitation system. This mobile system costs a fraction of what a full-fledged waste system would cost and will potentially save the community tens of millions of dollars.

Then there’s the difficult task of community outreach and cultural preservation. The people of Kivalina are deeply attached to the land and sea — hunting and gathering have sustained the Inupiat people for countless generations.

Right now, youth leaders like Alexis are cataloguing and teaching traditional methods of subsistence through a Food Sovereignty Project. The people of Kivalina harvest the land abundantly through hunting and gathering and the more food independence Kivalina can achieve, the more viable its future becomes.

Only by Plane

You can walk the span of Kivalina in 20 minutes, crossing over lanes carved by snowmobiles because there are no cars, receiving friendly waves from everyone. You’ll pass kids in winter gear playing baseball or riding bikes, freshly flayed animal pelts, arches made from bowhead whale bones, half-buried row boats, all sorts of snowmobiles, and dilapidated homes with wind-worn facades.

There are two large cylinders in the center of town, one holds filtered water, the other raw water.

People can get water from the filtered tank for a dollar, but nobody drinks this water because of potential contamination. It’s only used for washing, doing dishes, and cleaning.

Drinking water is harder to come by. The faucets don’t work — there’s only running water in the school, a community center with showers, and a rudimentary health clinic.

“Every drop of water that I give my kids, it has to be filtered,” said Hawley, the youth advocate. “I don’t trust our own water anymore.”

Most homes have reverse osmosis filtration machines, large plastic chambers that sift out contaminants, but the grocery store is the safest bet for clean water. There, a case of six gallons of water is around $45 and smaller water bottles go for several dollars. All the store’s wares are flown in on 10-seater planes, making prices prohibitively expensive in a town where few people earn a steady income.

In fact, the daily 10-seater plane is the only way to get to Kivalina.

The lack of routes in and out contributes to a sense of claustrophobia in this snow globe at the tip of the world, cradled by tradition and rocked by the future.

The tightness is felt more sharply inside homes, where three or four families crowd into a few bedrooms, spread across generations. For young adults — unable to secure a home for their families because there is simply no place to build, no place to go — there’s a constant feeling of a future deferred. More than a quarter of the island lives below the poverty line and jobs are hard to come by.

Most homes use “honey buckets” as a toilet — they’re containers with plastic bags that have to be emptied multiple times a day at a sewage lagoon far beyond the village, past the air strip. Families that don’t have a way to travel that far sometimes let the bags pile up outside their homes. In the summer months, the smell can be strong. Occasionally the landfill floods and pollution seeps into fisheries.

Strep throat, pneumonia, stomach bugs, and skin infections spread swiftly throughout the island. Kids running around have coughs and face rashes. There’s no full-time doctor or dentist and if someone gets very sick or injured, they have to get airlifted to the nearest city.

And now climate change is beginning to color all of these problems.

“You can talk to anyone here, maybe even the children, they’re able to talk to you about climate change,” Enoch Adams Jr., a whaling captain and Episcopal preacher, told me.

The changes are happening too fast for people not to notice: Rain in December, massive flooding, brutal storms crashing against the shore, early ice and permafrost melt.

“We’re in a slow-moving forest fire,” said Rick Steiner of Oasis Earth, an Anchorage-based environmental justice group. “We can’t see it with the benefit of 20 to 30 years of hindsight right now, but we’re in the middle of a major ecological shift, and in many ways a major ecological collapse in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.”

The animals are another indicator.

There are birds roosting in the area that had never been spotted before. Skates — creatures that look like stingrays — have recently been seen in waters that had once been too cold. Seals, in particular, are acting strangely — sometimes they’ll be sitting on a beach deliriously swatting at the air, oblivious to your approach. Other times, they’ll have skin lesions that show as their fur falls off.

All the primary animals that they hunt — ducks, caribou, seals, tom-cod, salmon, arctic char, and more — have been affected in one way or another by climate change.

And then there are the whales. People hear them each year, moans booming under and across the ice.

“You can’t go out in this kind of environment unless you really know what you’re doing.”

Enoch Adams Jr.

They’re tantalizingly within grasp — bowheads are coming closer to the shore each year to evade the Orcas, which have recently expanded their range because of warming waters. But nobody can get to them because the ice is so thin.

“You can’t go out in this kind of environment unless you really know what you’re doing,” Adams, Jr., said. “You might not come home.”

Enoch Adams Jr. (Hans Glick / Global Citizen)



“The last time we got a whale, [in] 96, was when all these changes started to become noticeable,” Adams, Jr., said. “We’ve got a lot of men who were little boys back then, they don’t have the experience of heading out on this ice because it’s been too thin.”

Relocation is also within grasp, but it has come to feel like a mirage for many people. And much as the failure to catch whales deepens collective anxiety of cultural loss, the failure to relocate deepens existing community problems.

Each year, the town gets more crowded. Young adults, feeling cramped by a lack of opportunity and the tightness of the island, often despair. While data is unavailable, I was told by community members that depression and suicide rates are high, and that three young people had killed themselves the year before.

“When you can’t determine how you want to live in your own place, how are you going to have hope?” said Swan, the activist. “We’re an isolated community. So isolated we’re forgotten.”

It’s with good reason that some in the town are losing hope. While the state has set aside funds to support them, a litany of red tape and Catch-22s prevents progress.

The school is too small, but the state’s School Construction Grant Fund won’t use the $43 million allocated for a new building until relocation happens. But relocation can’t happen until the new site has key infrastructure, like a school.

The community needs better access to water and sanitation, but the state won’t build a sewage system until enough people are living on the relocation site. But people can’t move until the relocation site has basic things like some sort of sewage system.

The longer that relocation is delayed, the more life on the island becomes harder.

“[The Inupiat people] don’t see climate change as an isolated issue,” said Terry Chapin, an expert on arctic biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. “They see it as part of other changes in their life, including the rising costs of commercial goods, because everything has to be flown in through air, issues with drugs and alcohol that stem from social disconnect.”

“They’re trying to navigate all these things simultaneously,” he said.

Small Town Politics

Politics at all levels is complicated — there are competing interests, different factions, budgets and realities to contend with, constituents to please, outside groups to court, coalitions to form, and expectations to manage.

Kivalina is no different. Except while local politics elsewhere is generally concerned with mundane matters — where to put a street sign, what a park should look like — in Kivalina, the stakes are drastically higher. The community is navigating the unprecedented: a coordinated retreat from climate change.

Relocation planning in Kivalina involves a complex matrix of local decision makers. And while everyone agrees that relocation must happen, coordinating the move with local, state, and federal governments has been challenging.



To do that, they’ve been embarking on an effort of radical transparency to make a village- and worldwide understanding of the issues and plans possible. Years of material relating to Kivalina’s relocation — meetings, ideas, achievements — are being uploaded onto a digital archive. Every item will be available to Kivalina people and select items will be made public by its owners to be studied around the world.

Although environmental forces are rendering the barrier island uninhabitable, the community is taking charge of the relocation process.

When I visited Kivalina in early April, I attended a meeting of relocation leaders who have spent decades working through complex bureaucracies, mastering the systems and dynamics of state and federal government. They’ve petitioned time and again for logistical and financial support, filed lawsuits, held rallies, and brokered with the biggest regulators in the country.

“I was a young man when we became a relocation committee,” said Joe Swan Sr., a man in his 80s. “I told my people that I will fight until I die.”

Part of this engagement stems from not wanting to repeat the traumas of the past — when their ancestors were forced to settle on the island in the first place. The people of Kivalina refuse to be seen as victims or bystanders, and they refuse to let community interests be ignored. They have a deep commitment to each other, their culture, and the environment.

"I am cashless, I have no income, but spiritually, mentally, I am not poor."

Colleen Swan.

“My life is to make life better for these people,” said Colleen Swan, an advocate for Kivalina. “They’re suffering.”

“By my own standards, I am not poor,” she said. “I am cashless, I have no income, but spiritually, mentally, I am not poor.”

They’re also driven by a sense of global responsibility. All across the world, climate displacement is happening — sometimes violently, sometimes slowly, sometimes with no institutional support at all.

Indigenous communities around the world fought to get the Paris climate accord to include the goal of keeping global temperature increases under 1.5 degrees celsius rather than 2 degrees celsius, an enormous difference.

Kivalina sees itself as part of this narrative. In 2015 when President Barack Obama toured Alaska to see the effects of climate change on indigenous communities, it was Kivalina’s tribal council president Millie Hawley who introduced him at an event in the regional city Kotzebue.

Obama wasn’t able to visit Kivalina because the air strip is too small to fit Air Force One, but he flew over the island and observed its extreme fragility.

“The people who live on the island [Kivalina] that we flew over today can move,” he said at the time. “It's painful for those residents, but it can be done.”

A New Approach

“The effects of climate change are varied and opportunistic, but one thing is consistent,” Michael Kimmelman wrote for The New York Times. “They are like sparks in the tinder. They expose cities’ biggest vulnerabilities, inflaming troubles that politicians and city planners often ignore or try to paper over. And they spread outward, defying borders.”

In Kivalina, the vulnerabilities can no longer be papered over and everyone in the village knows this.

“We need to get homes built right now,” said Swan. “We need to make life better for our people.”

But despite the sense that they’re being strung along, that each delay is a wasted opportunity, the community is still striving for a better future.

Dolly and Reppi are preparing for a journey far onto the ice to catch a bowhead. This is the year, everyone believes. This is the time to break the streak. In Alaskan whaling communities, catching a bowhead has powerful ripple effects — it’s believed to be a deeply spiritual being that spreads good luck and prosperity throughout a community.

Around the island, there are coolers filled with provisions. Camping and hunting supplies have been gathered. All the snowmobiles, damaged from the harsh conditions of the past few months, have been repaired.

Reppi’s crew is almost ready to go. The right day just has to present itself.

And the ice — which might be too thin, have perilous snow-covered holes, or break and drift toward Russia — has to hold.

In 2016, more refugees arrived in Uganda–including nearly half a million people from South Sudan alone–than crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. While the numbers in Africa are increasing, the situation isn’t new: As the world continues to focus on the European refugee crisis, an equally large crisis has been unfolding in Africa.

A new visualization shows the flow of refugees around the world from 2000 to 2015, and makes the lesser-known story in Africa–and in places like Sri Lanka in 2006 or Colombia in 2007–as obvious as what has been happening more recently in Syria. Each yellow dot represents 17 refugees leaving a country, and each red dot represents refugees arriving somewhere else. (The full version of the map, too large to display here, represents every single refugee in the world with a dot.) Here’s some of what you’re seeing: In 2001, tens of thousands of refugees fled conflict in Afghanistan, while others fled civil war in Sudan (including the “Lost Boys,” orphans who in some cases were resettled in the U.S.). By 2003, the genocide in Darfur pushed even more people from Sudan. In 2006, war drove Lebanese citizens to Syria; Sri Lankans fleeing civil war went to India. In 2007, as conflict worsened in Colombia, refugees fled to nearby countries such as Venezuela. After leading demonstrations in Burma against dictatorial rule, Buddhist monks and others fled to Thailand. In 2008, a surge of Tibetan refugees fled to India, while Afghan, Iraqi, and Somali refugees continued to leave their home countries in large numbers. By 2009, Germany was taking in large numbers of refugees from countries such as Iraq. In 2010, another surge of refugees left Burma, while others left Cuba. By 2012, the civil war in Syria pushed huge numbers of refugees into countries such as Jordan. Ukrainian refugees began to flee unrest in 2013, and in greater numbers by 2014. By 2015, the greatest number of refugees were coming from Syria, though mass movement from African countries such as South Sudan also continued–and because most of those refugees went to neighboring countries rather than Europe, the migration received less media attention. In 2015, the U.S. resettled 69,933 refugees; Uganda, with a population roughly eight times smaller, took in more than 100,000 people. Developing countries host nearly 90% of the world’s refugees. “Often the debates we have in society start with emotion and extreme thoughts, like, ‘Oh, refugees are invading the U.S.,'” says Illah Nourbakhsh, director of the Community Robotics, Education, and Technology Empowerment (CREATE) Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, the lab that developed the technology used create the new visualization. “You can’t get past that–you can’t build common ground for people to actually talk about real issues and how to solve them.” Showing people data in an animated, interactive visualization, he says, is “an interesting shortcut into your brain, where the visual evidence is more rhetorically compelling than any graph or chart that I show you. That visual evidence often moves you from somebody who’s questioning the data to somebody who can see the data. And now they want to talk about what to do about it.”

The lab began working on its Explorables project, a platform designed to help make sense of big data, four years ago. To make big data–with billions of data points, dozens of different fields of information, changing over time–easier to explore, the platform layers animations over maps. The team has also used systems like Google Earth to explore big data, but even it can only display a few hundred markers, and it requires installation on computers. The researchers realized that they could use a graphics processor in someone’s computer directly, in the same way that a video game does. “What’s kind of cool is that the video game revolution has changed the computer’s architecture over the last decade,” he says. “So the computers have this amazing ability to very quickly render on the screen.” That technology is combined with an ability to display only the resolution needed for the data you’re zoomed in on, making it possible to share massive amounts of data. You can watch a video of the refugee flow below: The researchers have used the platform to display data about inequality, carbon dioxide emissions, and the bleaching of coral reefs. Working with the Brazil-based think tank Igarape Institute, they helped incorporate the institute’s data on the fragility of cities, from unemployment and pollution to the risk of violence. The flow of refugees was one of the stories they wanted to tell, both in the case of Syria and the rest of the world. “The prevailing notion that all these Syrians are going to Europe is nonsense because as you zoom out you realize they’re going to three neighboring countries around Syria the most,” he says. “There’s a little flow to Europe. Then to really blow people away, we pan south, and suddenly you see these massive plumes of Central African refugees moving from country to country that are completely bigger than the Syrian refugee flows. And here’s the untold story.”

They do this every year. It is the sort of thing those of you concerned about an overload of refugees in your communities can’t really do, first and foremost because it is expensive to travel to Washington. And, our pro-reform side has no money!!!

I suspect your tax dollars helped pay for the lobbying organized each year through one of the nine major federal resettlement contractors—Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (headquartered in a posh section of Baltimore).

However, this story from the Huffington Post that focuses on visits to Texas’s two US Senators confirms what we have said and what you should do—keep up the political pressure on your Washington reps from back home! And, I mean, keep it up!

Huffington Post:

WASHINGTON ― On a hot D.C. summer day on Tuesday, seven refugees from Texas made their way to the office of their home state senator, Ted Cruz, to do what one does in the nation’s capital: lobby.

[….]

The former refugees had come to Washington for the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service Leadership Academy, where they had spent the last few days training and strategizing on how to help new arrivals and convince politicians that it was right and humane to do the same. It was the fifth year of the program, with 48 former refugees from 17 states participating.

This year is different from the last four. Now they are operating in the age of Donald Trump, who wants to cut the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S. and bar them from entry for at least four months. The Texas advocates are facing an anti-refugee wave at the state level that Trump tapped into nationally. Texas took in the second-highest number of refugees of any state in fiscal year 2016, but its Republican leadership has echoed the president’s approach, last year taking the extreme move of dropping out of the resettlement program, making it the largest state to do so. Gov. Greg Abbott has also tried to bar Syrian refugees from the state entirely. And while Republican officials in Texas can’t legally keep refugees out, they’ve done their best to say they are unwelcome.

Despite the open hostility that is exhibited by their state ― or perhaps because of it ― refugee advocates feel an intense urgency to change minds. That includes Cruz, who supported measures to bar certain groups of refugees and backed Trump’s travel ban, which is now blocked in the courts. The former refugees knew that having a positive reception from congressional staffers wouldn’t change much, if anything. But they felt that if they met the staff in person, they could work to maintain and grow relationships within the state. After visiting Cruz’s Washington office, Nsenga suggested that they reach out to Cruz’s offices in Texas as soon as possible to request meetings, since they take some time to schedule.

After visiting Cruz’s office they went on to meet Senator Cornyn’s staff and we learned a very important bit of information for Texas taxpayers concerned about the impact of refugee resettlement on the state:

This time they decided to also ask what they could do to win the senator over. They said the Cornyn staffer told them that his office gets a lot of calls expressing concerns about refugee resettlement and hardly any from people who support refugees. [Hint!—ed]



“She said, ‘You can help by educating fellow Texans about refugees,’” Emmanuel Sebagabo, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said afterward.

It was a tangible bit of information that the former refugees felt could serve them well.

[….]

…. They [politicians] don’t base their policy positions on whether constituents set up apartments for people resettling in their states, and they haven’t been universally moved by protests against Trump’s executive orders. Politicians care about getting elected and reelected; they care about doing what their constituents call on them (literally and figuratively) to do.

It’s a basic principle of advocacy, but it can get lost when activists are focused on more immediate matters, like getting people resettled in a new country. Now up against Trump, Abbott, Cruz, Cornyn and other Republicans, the refugee advocates got a reminder that they can’t forget about the politics. They need to convince more fellow Texans that refugee resettlement is a good thing, but that requires combating messages from politicians who spread fear that refugees can be dangerous. They need to convince those who support refugees to not just offer places to stay, warm meals and social services. They need them to call politicians’ offices and show up at town halls.

Yup!

By the way, this article focused on Texas, but you can be sure they were visiting YOUR Senators and members of Congress too!

A collection of fairy tales written by child refugees in Greece has gone on sale to help those like the book’s authors.

Travelling Tales features a rugby-playing dog, a king who grew to love animals and chickens fighting an alien invasion among its eight stories.

The book is the brainchild of Brazilian journalist Debora de Pina Castiglione and her sister Beatriz. The two combined their love of words and illustrations to create the book but the ideas came directly from the children.

Debora ran workshops with Syrian and Kurdish children aged between four and 14 years old, at three refugee camps close to Thessaloniki in Vasilika, Lagadikia and Oreokastro.

(Travelling Tales)

It gave the children something to do without focusing on their own lives.

“The idea was not to have the children talk about their journeys or experiences fleeing war, at least not directly,” Debora said. “It was to let them tell the stories they wanted to, in ways they chose themselves.

“I think it's important for young people to engage with one another. Children all over the world are watching the refugee situation, or hearing it on news programmes their parents watch and listen to, and as well as hoping it would be an interesting project for the children at the camps, I wanted to do something so the children outside of the crisis could see the children caught up in it on their own terms, as children with fun and interesting stories, just like they are.”

And there is something entirely captivating about the stories. In The Travelling Princess, Amira shuns her royal title to live as a poor person who goes around giving away gold she found as she explored the world.

(Travelling Tales)

In Aliens vs Chicken, Earth is under attack from extraterrestrials who want to steal all the chicken eggs in the world. While humans are relieved about the aliens’ demands, the chickens are not happy and fight back, reclaiming the eggs.

The story was written by nine-year-old Shahd who lives in the military camp of Lagadikia. Debora describes her stories as “full of adventure”.

“Her creativity reminds us that there are heroes even where we least expect to find them.”

“We spent four months with the children,” Debora added. “In some cases, the children spoke English very well, and had quite clear ideas of their stories. In others, we worked with a translator, and also spent time with them to help them develop their ideas, to make the stories hold together better.

(Travelling Tales)

“But the point was that these are the stories of the children, so we didn’t change their words, or add anything they did not include themselves.”

Five professional illustrators helped to bring the stories to life, including Beatriz.

The book was published last month and is available in English as well as Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, German and Dutch. It is for sale via Amazon priced at £10.

Money collected from the sale of the book will be used to help support projects that look for alternative housing solutions to the military camps.

A new Cochrane Library Special Collection, developed in conjunction with Evidence Aid, brings together Cochrane Reviews addressing health conditions relevant to refugees and asylum seekers.

Migrant health crises require a range of planned and coordinated interventions, and, as this collection highlights, a foundation of relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are needed to inform the development of community programs, clinical and public health guidelines, and national and international polices. Equity methods are being used to identify disadvantaged migrant groups that may face health inequities in a humanitarian emergency, and systematic reviews can help to prevent unintended harms and consequences of interventions. The Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group has established a migrant health subgroup aiming to address unfair and unjust health outcomes among migrant populations.

The current European migrant crisis has seen the arrival of a large numbers of asylum seekers and refugees, amid concern about their integration into societies and health systems. The International Organization for Migration predicts that global international migration (people seeking a new life in another country) will double from 215 million to more than 400 million by 2050. Without effective integration or resettlement, many fear long-term social and health problems.

A robust, high-quality evidence base can help marshal political will and strengthen policy-making capacity and service delivery. Systematic reviews may also help build provider capacity to ensure effective service provision, and they may help improve collaboration among nongovernmental organizations.

The field of migrant health research has grown rapidly over the last 15 years. Social science researchers have studied the impact of migration on a range of social outcomes, and psychiatrists and anthropologists have studied how trauma and differences in culture and values may impact mental health. Infectious disease specialists have identified the conditions that may begin or emerge in the migration process, such as tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, varicella, and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

This Special Collection presents systematic reviews on health conditions relevant for migrating populations, most notably migrants who are affected by conflict, poverty, and forced migration. The reviews focus on conditions relating to the transit or the particular population involved, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, skin infections, sexual and physical violence, tuberculosis, and vaccine-preventable diseases.

According to the newspaper Bild, the EU has taken in refugees 5 times more than it provides for an agreement with Ankara. From 6254 taken Syrians in Germany drove 2270.

The EU took five times that of Turkish migrants than it was initially stipulated in the agreement on refugees signed with the government in Ankara. New data of the European Commission quoted by the newspaper Bild on Tuesday, June 27. Since the entry into force of the agreements with the Turkish government in March 2016 back to Turkey was deported 1210 refugees, who illegally came to Europe via the Greek Islands.

Over this period of time Turkish territory was taken 6254 Syrian, which are distributed in 15 countries. Of these, 2270 as a result of profit in Germany. Thus, one of the deported refugee have more than 5 accepted — at that time, under the Treaty with Turkey, the ratio must be "one to one".

The main reason for the delay in sending refugees from Greece to Turkey, is said to be too long lasting the process of reviewing requests for asylum. It is also indicated that the number of people living in the Greek refugee camps has exceeded norm almost twice.
All LAO immigration and refugee services will continue after July 1, 2017

Monday, June 26, 2017

As a result of intensive stakeholder consultations in May and June, and ongoing discussions with government, LAO has decided to continue immigration and refugee services at the current level at this time. More time is needed to complete talks with the federal government about securing a funding solution for immigration and refugee services so that future suspension of services can be avoided.

In addition to ongoing discussions with government partners, LAO will continue to consult with stakeholders on ways we can work together to sustain quality cost-effective services.

LAO looks forward to the results of the federal government review of policies and procedures related to refugee determination in Canada, which we believe can contribute to a more cost-effective and fair process.

The current international refugee crisis is one of the greatest, most complex humanitarian challenges of our generation. Today, the number of people displaced from their homes by violence and persecution is unprecedented in human history. By the end of 2015, over 65 million people were forcibly displaced, with nearly a third–20 million–living outside of their countries as refugees.

"IKEA is committed to creating a better everyday life and that includes respecting the basic human rights of every individual. We believe every person has equal value and that the global family is strengthened when all of humanity is recognized," commented Evamay Lawson, IKEA U.S. Community Relations Manager. Lawson added, "We are pleased we can make a difference in our community's refugee families by donating beds and bedding to help make their new homes comfortable with a good night's sleep."

According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, sleep helps your brain work properly. "While you're sleeping, your brain is preparing for the next day. It's forming new pathways to help you learn and remember information. Studies show that a good night's sleep improves learning. It also supports healthy growth and development."**

"The way IKEA has demonstrated leadership in service and support to refugees is so humbling. 5000 Dreams is more than just a warm, safe place to lay one's head. It is a statement of solidarity and compassion for people who never expected to find themselves displaced. As an international business, they are setting a high bar for both business and government leaders to do all they can to support the uprooted," stated Lavinia Limon, President/CEO, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.

"ECDC's resettlement network very much appreciates IKEA's leadership in helping refugees. ECDC stands with IKEA U.S. in saying that refugees are welcome," said Dr. Tsehaye Teferra, Director of ECDC. "After experiencing significant hardship, refugees are now rebuilding their lives and will have one of the most basic of comforts---a bed. ECDC welcomes this partnership with IKEA in welcoming refugees to their new life in America."

"When refugees arrive in the U.S. they bring little to nothing with them," said David Miliband, IRC president and CEO, "so the little things you and I might take for granted every day can make a huge difference in their comfort and in establishing the feeling of home. Now more than ever, the International Rescue Committee – and more importantly, the resilient refugees we serve – look to innovative partnerships like IKEA's 5,000 Dreams to help refugees build a home here in America."

Some publicly available information from HHS & Pew.

Of the 84,995 refugees admitted to the United States in fiscal year 2016, the largest numbers came from the Democratic Republic of Congo , Syria , Burma ( Myanmar ) and Iraq . (Pew)

in fiscal year 2016, the largest numbers came from the , , ( ) and . (Pew) Since 1975, the U.S. has resettled more than 3 million refugees, with nearly 77 percent being either Indochinese or citizens of the former Soviet Union . Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, annual admissions figures have ranged from a high of 207,116 in 1980, to a low of 27,100 in 2002. (HHS)

IKEA U.S. has been committed to helping its local communities through many social programs including Early Steps to School Success, Feeding the Future and the Life Improvement programs that benefit community schools, organizations and institutions which need a helping hand through IKEA product donations and IKEA co-worker volunteer support.

On a global level, since 2010, the IKEA Foundation has committed over $165 million*** (€148 million) to UNHCR to provide shelter, access to education, livelihood opportunities and renewable energy to families and children living in Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Jordan. Working with the social enterprise organizations - Better Shelter and UNHCR – the IKEA Foundation has created a safer and more durable shelter. In 2015, UNHCR bought 10,000 shelters to house displaced families in several countries, including Greece, Iraq, Djibouti, Chad and Serbia. The IKEA Foundation Brighter Lives for Refugees campaign in IKEA stores globally raised $34.4 million (€30.8 million) in 2014 and 2015, to bring sustainable lighting, energy and education to refugee camps.

The IKEA Foundation recently created another refugee program with a positive societal impact; purchasing rugs from Jordan and partnering with local refugee social enterprises/foundations. This program will enable 200 Syrian refugee woman to produce saleable rugs through IKEA.

NOTE: IKEA U.S. will be working with 3 refugee agencies for the bulk of the donations, however 6 IKEA stores (Orlando, charlotte, West Chester, Portland, Round Rock & Memphis), will be working with local refugee organizations. IKEA Long Island is not participating due to lack of local refugee organization.

*5,000 beds will be donated between 2 years, 2017 and 2018

12 million Syrians forcibly displaced

Syrians continued to be the largest forcibly displaced population, with 12 million people at the end of 2016. Colombians were the second-largest group, followed by Afghans. Other large displaced populations at the end of 2016 included Iraq and South Sudan.

Looking at the forcibly displaced as a proportion of the national population, the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) was the most affected, with 650 out of every 1,000 people forcibly displaced. Other emergencies also had deep consequences in 2016 continuing to cause significant humanitarian needs, in the countries least able to respond to them. The war in South Sudan led to a rapid outflow of refugees and many new IDPs, the refugee population from South Sudan grew by 85 per cent during the year. Similarly, the refugee population from Burundi increased by 39 per cent during 2016 while the IDP population in that country quadrupled to 141,200 people.

South Sudan, the fastest growing refugee crisis

In 2016, the South Sudanese refugee crisis was the fastest growing in the world. The large number of infants, children, and pregnant women among the South Sudanese refugees made the humanitarian response particularly challenging. South Sudan and the neighbouring countries are among the poorest and least developed countries in the world, with limited resources to deal with the needs and challenges associated with hosting displaced people.

Although most refugees remained close to home, some moved further afield, resulting in an increase in refugee and asylum-seeker populations in some European States. In Germany, this population rose to 1.3 million people by the end of 2016, while in Sweden it reached 313,300.

Around half of the 2016 refugee population were children. Without the protection of family, unaccompanied and separated children are particularly at risk of exploitation and abuse. The number of such children who were reported as having applied for asylum reached 75,000 during the year, although this number is considered to be an underestimate.

Returns increase

In 2016, some half a million refugees and 6.5 million IDPs returned to their countries or areas of origin, an increase compared to 2015. However, the context in which many displaced people returned was complex, leading to concerns that many returns may not be sustainable. Resettlement provided a solution for 189,300 refugees.

In March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commission, at its 47th session, decided to establish an Expert Group on Refugee and IDP Statistics (EGRIS). The group consists of participants from national authorities, international statistical organizations, and other technical experts, led by Statistics Norway, Eurostat, and UNHCR, and aims to address the challenges related to refugee and IDP statistics.

As the legality of President Trump's travel ban is debated , CNN spoke with Muslims who came to the United States between 1982 and 2014. We asked them about current attitudes and policies toward Muslims and refugees, why they came to America -- and what their hopes are for the future.

A project in India is helping five Afghan refugee women who escaped the Taliban to embark on a journey to run their own business. The refugees are battling traditional gender roles by going out to work. The women are also playing their part in fighting pollution. New Delhi generates about 650,000kg of plastic waste daily. Among the waste - disposable plastic cutlery and plates. So Farah and her colleagues are making edible tableware from millet and wheat flour. They turn over a small profit averaging INR7500 monthly, which is divided equally between them. In time the refugees will take over the entire business and Farah will become her own boss. (Reuters)

I heard murmurings that they were going to beat a batty man – a Jamaican slur for a gay man – after school one day. I didn’t know that I was the target.

After the incident, I ran to my principal. He looked at me, grimaced and said, “Get out of my office with your nastiness.” I was 16. I decided then and there that Jamaica would not feature in my happily-ever-after.

Per capita, the Immigration and Refugee Board reports that the highest number of LGBTQ refugees in 2015 came from Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Namibia and Albania.

Homosexuality is illegal in Jamaica, and the island nation’s churches extol a puritanical concept of virtue that fuels its ignorant buggery laws. Every Jamaican can easily quote Leviticus 20:13 – “If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.”

I remember sitting in church and hearing the preacher say, “Everyone can be forgiven, even a child molester. But not a homosexual.” I still detest that man.

There are two types of refugees: a Convention refugee and a Protected Person. Convention refugees have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on their race, religion, political opinions, nationality or membership in a particular social group. Protected people risk torture, unusual punishment or death if they return to their country of birth.

To this day, my family doesn’t know about the process I went through to gain permanent resident status in Canada.

I was told I was crazy for not hiring an immigration lawyer. I couldn’t afford one, so I hoped that if I followed the application process to a T, I’d be successful. I remember getting my ex to print upwards of 250 pages of newspaper articles about being gay in Jamaica to be used as supplemental documents in my hearing. I got letters from friends back in Jamaica and Reverend Brent Hawkes of Metropolitan Community Church, where I was a member.

The day of my hearing, I went to the Immigration and Refugee Board wearing my crispest white shirt, armed with copies of all the submitted documents including the jumbo-sized binder containing all those articles. While waiting for my hearing, I overheard a man from Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya (my built-in accent detector sometimes works) pleading his case. I could tell it was not going well. I began to sweat. Profusely. If I was denied, I knew my future in Jamaica might include living deeply closeted or being forced to marry a woman and live a lie.

× Expand Kenyan trans activist Biko Beauttah says her life would be very different had she stayed. When asked what her life would be like back in Kenya were her petition denied she said: “I would most likely have been a successful doctor, unhappily married to a woman who deserves better, with beautiful children whose only wish for me would probably be that I was happy."

My friend Biko Beauttah has also benefited from Canada’s refugee process. She came to Canada from Kenya and requested asylum as a trans woman. We both feel so fortunate to be living in Canada.

Biko arrived in February 2006 and attended a number of hearings to plead her case for asylum. It took her two years, but she finally received the letter informing her that Canada wanted to offer her sanctuary and the tools that she needed to thrive. Now, Biko proudly carries the Canadian flag everywhere she goes. She’s an activist and currently sits on the board of Pride Toronto.

She frequently says things like, “Canada is where it’s at,” or “And then God said, ‘Let there be beauty,’ and boom, there was Canada.” She can name so many instances, including the current Bill C-16, that show the world Canada is committed to the inclusion of all its citizens.

“I would most likely have been a successful doctor, unhappily married to a woman who deserves better, with beautiful children whose only wish for me would probably be that I was happy,” Biko says, considering what her life would be like back in Kenya if her petition had been denied. “I would basically be living with a beating heart but devoid of a soul. What kind of life do you think that is? It’s not the kind of life I wanted for myself, and it breaks my heart to know that everywhere in the world, not just in Kenya, people are walking around with beating hearts but no souls. This to me is the most unfair injustice. Such is life for transgender people in most countries.”

I met Patrick on Vibes Connect, a dating website for Caribbean people. The code for gay men was to say you were “seeking friends” and not including a photo in your profile. A Jamaican living in Toronto, Patrick had a wife and children back home. He was working and sending money to them each month. From adolescence, he knew he was sexually attracted to men but could never accept living “that way,” especially in rural Jamaica. So he moved to Toronto to be himself.

But he would never call himself gay, but rather a MWHSWM (man who has sex with men). I didn’t blame him. I didn’t fully accept myself as queer until I was 30. He thought I was brave for coming out and applying for refugee protection. He was too afraid of being found out. I have a friend from high school whose parents, when they found out he was gay, gave him U.S. $10,000 and told him to never contact them again.

I still text Patrick around Jamaican Independence and Christmas. His wife and children now live with him in Brampton. He still sleeps with men.

Of all the Jamaican refugees applying for Convention Refugee status in Canada in 2015, 45 per cent were successful. Kenyans saw an acceptance rate of 56 per cent. These are very high numbers (compared with acceptance rates in Argentina, Brazil and Chile that range from 0 to 26 per cent).

The refugee process is not an easy one – out of the 16,210 refugee applications made to the Immigration and Refugee Board, 5,342 were declined. There is the burden of proof – just how do you prove that you are gay in a country where being gay is illegal? Friends may refuse to write letters on your behalf, afraid the paper trail will lead back to them. Presenting as gay or trans can lead to bodily harm. I was once approached in the grocery store and told I would be shot once I got outside. Why? I was gesticulating.

Some are trying to make the LGBTQ refugee claimant process more stringent. Remember the man whose hearing I overheard? He kept mixing up stories, and the judge didn’t believe he was truly gay. My story was straightforward, and I proved my sexuality via affidavits from brave friends, local activists and the fact that I lived with a lover.

Whenever Canada Day comes along, I’m filled with pride and gratitude. My life if I hadn’t been granted asylum would be remarkably different – possibly ending with suicide. Canada saved my life, and for that I am eternally grateful.

For me, the process was humanizing, and each person I met along the way treated me with respect and kindness. As a Black queer man with an accent, I couldn’t ask for a more respectful- immigration process. And each time I travel and come back to Pearson, nothing fills me with more emotion than hearing, “Welcome home, Mr. Gray.”

I broke down crying when I opened the government-brown envelope containing the letter saying my petition was granted. I fell to my knees right there in the mailroom of my apartment building. I called my ex and told him the good news. I celebrated that night with wine from the good section of the LCBO, resting my head on my boyfriend’s chest and watching an episode of Queer As Folk. Because why not?

Sadly, not only do they rob these poor people. Many times their victims are raped, beaten, and murdered by these third world invaders, including babies and children.

It's sinful that our leaders refuse to stop this crisis. The fault lies with them. Hopefully, soon, the people will hold the politicians who have betrayed their own people to account for their actions.
How to address India's chronic waste problem and empower refugee women who often flounder in their adopted homelands

By Nita Bhalla

NEW DELHI, June 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farah Naz is used to attracting scathing remarks and disapproving looks from neighbours in her Afghan refugee community as she leaves for work each day.

They tell her she is "not a good woman", what she is doing is "shameful" and that her rightful place is inside her south Delhi home - caring for her sick husband and five children.

But after fleeing the Taliban five years ago - where she was drenched in kerosene and almost burnt alive, her husband was ordered killed, and her children were threatened with kidnap - the 32-year-old refugee woman is past caring what people think.

She is on her way to becoming a business woman.

"I had no choice but to work, and now I am proud," said Naz. "I am feeding my family and changing the view of women in my community, but most importantly I am doing a job which is showing that refugees also can do something good."

Naz is one of five Afghan refugee women who are not only battling traditional gender roles by going out to work, but who have also become unlikely warriors in the Indian capital's fight to curb plastic waste pollution.

The task is immense and 10 hands will not solve it. But this project is gaining international support for its twin roles of addressing India's chronic waste problem and empowering refugee women who often flounder in their adopted homelands.

Employed under "Project Patradya" - an initiative led by Delhi University students - the Afghan women produce and supply edible bowls, cups and cutlery to cafes and ice-cream parlours as an alternative to non-biodegradable plastic ones.

Made from millet and wheat flour, the biscuit-like tableware is gaining popularity in the West as a sustainable, environment-friendly option to disposable plastic utensils, and those behind the initiative believe India is an untapped market.

"We wanted to create a social enterprise model which was not only looking at improving the environment but also had a business plan that could employ excluded communities such as refugees," said 20-year-old commerce student Nishchay Hans.

PLAGUED WITH PLASTIC POLLUTION

Hans is one of more than 40 students at Kirori Mal College (KMC) who are part of Enactus, a charity that supports young people across the world work with poor communities and build sustainable, eco-friendly businesses.

Their projects range from creating mobile salons for unemployed hairdressers in Ghana to working with villagers in Malaysia to build home stays - all with the aim of eventually handing over the businesses to communities to run themselves.

With New Delhi generating around 650 metric tonnes (650,000 kg) of plastic waste daily, only 60 percent of which is recycled, KMC students honed in on plastic pollution as a serious and neglected social problem.

They found disposable plastic plates, bowls, cups and utensils make up much of the plastic waste in Delhi's burgeoning landfills, where it can take up to up to 1,000 years to decompose and leak pollutants into the soil and water.

Most of the litter and pollution affecting oceans also derives from plastics. This has dire consequences for marine species, which in turn is harmful for those further up the food chain, including humans, who consume the contaminated fish.

During their months of research, the students visited Delhi cafes and consulted restaurateurs, bakers and customers -- eventually settling on the idea of edible tableware as an alternative to use-and-throw utensils.

The students then approached the city's refugees to join their venture in a move welcomed by the United Nations.

"Not only are refugees learning valuable new skills, they are also part of a meaningful and innovative initiative," said Ipshita Sengupta, policy associate at the U.N. Refugee Agency.

"Such projects demonstrate that refugees are active members of our society making positive contributions to the communities they live in."

BOMB BLASTS TO BUSINESS WOMEN

India - a safe haven in a volatile region - is home to more than 200,000 refugees and asylum seekers, many of whom were forced to flee conflict or persecution in neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, China, Afghanistan and Myanmar.

But the country has not signed the landmark 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out the legal obligations of states to protect refugees, nor does it have any domestic legislation in place to ensure their basic rights.

As a result, many refugees are vulnerable to harassment and exploitation. They cannot easily access education and health services and endure job discrimination and low pay.

The 11,000-plus Afghan refugees in India fare better than some other poor communities, but many still live hand to mouth.

Opportunities to improve their lives and gain new skills are limited, so when Naz and the four other women were offered the chance to join Project Patradya, they did not hesitate.

Most are the wives of once wealthy businessmen who had good lives in Kabul, but the constant fear of suicide attacks at schools, bomb blasts at markets and death and extortion threats from the Taliban left them with to choice but to flee.

In India now for almost five years, the roles have reversed and these women are the breadwinners - some now widows, others have husbands who are too sick to work or unable to find a job.

They work five hours daily at a charity office, above a hardware store along the bustling narrow lanes of Bhogal market, where they sit around a large table, carefully kneading and rolling dough, cutting and placing it into baking moulds.

As well as making the products, the women are also trained in sales and marketing, meet customers and take orders, with the understanding they will run the business within three years.

Patradya has been in operation for six months and is currently supplying edible tableware to 10 cafes and ice-cream parlours in Delhi, as well as taking online orders.

The women are turning over a small profit, averaging 7,500 rupees ($115) monthly, which is divided equally between them.

"It's just the beginning, so the money is not much," said Hasiba Fata, a 41-year-old mother of four, as she sprinkled flour over the ball of dough in front of her.

"But we are excited about the idea that we can become business women and run our own company, employ other people and also do something for the environment. Maybe it's possible."

Earlier this year, video director Meiert Avis was talking to Chris Cornell about their latest collaboration: a video for "The Promise" that Cornell had written and recorded for the 2016 historical film of the same name examining a love triangle in the wake of the Armenian genocide.

A lyric video released in March already featured scenes from the movie. For the official video, Cornell, directors Stefan Smith and Avis and the film's producer Eric Esrailian wanted to widen the scope both geographically and temporally, showing actual footage of fleeing refugees and war-torn cities from Libya, Syria and other countries alongside historical atrocities.

Avis would send rough cuts back and forth to Cornell for feedback, with the songwriter providing one main suggestion: Make it less depressing and more optimistic.

"It's very hard to put the pieces together for me," Avis tells Rolling Stone. "I've had many people break down when they watch the video. They either cry or are silent for 10 minutes."

Avis had no idea "The Promise" would end up being Cornell's final music video, released one month after the Soundgarden and Audioslave musician died by suicide. But the clip, featuring a performance Cornell recorded in Brooklyn in March, doubles as a fitting testament to the musician's lesser-known altruistic side.

"He was always curious about how others were feeling and he had an interest in learning about their lives," Esrailian, a philanthropist and close friend of Cornell's who brought him onto the project, tells Rolling Stone. "He was always asking how he could help me with some of the different non-profit projects I was working on."



"He was always curious about how others were feeling and he had an interest in learning about their lives."

"I was asking, 'How close to it am I and how far away from it am I?'" Cornell told Rolling Stone in March of the song. "I married into a Greek family, and my wife's grandparents were affected by the same genocide at the same time, since it was part of the same Ottoman Empire policy. So I saw the nearness to it."



For the video, the Armenian genocide becomes a microcosm of human-rights atrocities around the world, with Cornell drawing on personal experience, research and perennially pervasive headlines about Rwanda, Cambodia, Darfur and other regions for inspiration. "Chris had the idea of, 'How can we bridge the video … with fear-inducing images of what people have to deal with as well as messages and images of hope and perseverance and resilience and survival,' which is what the song is also about," Esrailian says.

This dichotomy – scenes of reunions, rescues and marches for justice contrast with bombed-out cities, debris-filled classrooms and crying mothers – stands at the heart of the video, whose original, darker cut focused more on genocide and its effects. Avis and Smith omitted the historical and explanatory text they originally conceived for the video, giving the images of disparate groups fleeing an ominous universality.

"When you destroy whole cultures and fragment families, you're left with psychic scars that last hundreds of years," says Avis, who helmed videos for Cornell's 2008 song "Ground Zero" and Audioslave's 2002 hit "Like a Stone." "When you're part of that history, it's very unnerving when you see it happen in front of you. There's a cognitive dissonance where we'll spend billions of dollars protecting the habitats of a certain kind of frog – the ecosystem is very important – but at the same time, the human ecosystem is completely ignored and a 10,000-year-old culture is considered worthless. That's what we're trying to address in the video."

Despite the heavy subject matter, both Avis and Esrailian say that Cornell's mood while working on the video was only positive. "He was happy, passionate, engaged and creative," says Esrailian. "He was focused but excited; not stressed. Just happy.

"I'm a physician and for me, when people are having mood disturbances – unless they're able to really hide it well – I'm pretty astute to being able to pick up on those things," he adds, noting the pair spoke almost daily. "Given the amount of time and how close we were, nothing gave me any sense that he would have any kind of sadness in his life. It was quite the opposite. … The song is a promise to persevere, survive and thrive – that's the song he was out there promoting."

Avis recalls one memory of shooting during a New York snowstorm earlier this year. "He was just talking about how happy it made him to scrape the snow off his doorstep that morning and to be in New York with his kids doing the normal shit that dads do," he says.

"I hope [the video] provides a wider human context for the tragedy of his death."

Per Cornell's request, the video's release date has special meaning. Tuesday, June 20th, marks World Refugee Day, an annual commemoration by the United Nations Refugee Agency to spotlight "the strength, courage and perseverance of millions of refugees." Cornell pledged to donate all proceeds from the song and video to humanitarian aid charity International Rescue Committee.

Oscar-nominated director Evgeny Afineesvky (Cries from Syria), Ross Kemp (Libya’s Migrant Hell) and Armenian photojournalist Nazik Armenakyan (Survivors) were among various filmmakers and charities to donate footage for use in the video.

"This movie's a great opportunity to tell a story that needs to be told, to help engage the healing of something that happened at a specific time and place, but it also reminds us that it's happening now and reminds us what to look for," Cornell told Rolling Stone earlier this year. "You can see it now in Syria, where you have one regime that is trying to deny any [killing] is happening and you have ISIS on the other side who is targeting a different group and advertising it."

"The hope is that we don't forget the past but that we also are able to shift gears and focus on the people that we can help today and actually get engaged and stimulate a sense of altruism and advocacy for those who are in danger," Esrailian says. "A lot of the same patterns and techniques used to oppress others or to violate human rights have been replicated over and over again that if we draw attention to it, we can raise the alarm and have people intervene. Everyone can do something, even if it's local or abroad. People don't have to feel like they're helpless."

With "The Promise" video, the confluence of personal and global tragedy blends with philanthropy and altruism. One month before his death, Cornell and his wife Vicky toured refugee camps in Greece and focused their Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation on child refugees. While Cornell never saw the finished video, he was, according to Avis, "very involved and certainly knew where we were going."

"I hope [the video] provides a wider human context for the tragedy of his death," says Avis. "I hope it creates something with purpose because Chris had purpose and to lose your purpose is a terrible thing."

In recent years the world has witnessed the devastating impacts of human conflict on the Syrian people and their treasured cultural sites, and WMF is eager to help renew community strength through ‘Building Conservation Capacity in Syria and Jordan,’ a new British-funded, Jordan-based heritage conservation training program for Syrian refugees and Jordanians. The project will also include innovative cultural education activities with public school students and teachers in order to build awareness of the value of cultural heritage to the daily lives of local communities.

World Monuments Fund has been committed to protecting and conserving heritage in conflict zones and strengthening communities around sustainable commitments to heritage for decades. WMF began work at Angkor Archaeological Park, Cambodia, in 1989, after the Khmer Rouge genocide decimated the local population, including those with the knowledge and skills to care for this remarkable heritage site. In the 1990s, at the end of the Balkan Wars, WMF partnered with UNESCO and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture to address destruction of heritage sites, including the reconstruction of Stari Most in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. More recently, in the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq, WMF launched programs in training, site management, and conservation skills at Babylon, in partnership with the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. These projects helped reinforce WMF’s understanding of cultural heritage as a source of pride and identity for those displaced by war, and also as a very powerful tool for healing after conflict.

A pioneering project to provide valuable heritage conservation skills

Thanks to the generous support of the British Council’s Cultural Protection Fund, the project will address a significant need to assist displaced Syrians, many of them young and in search of a future, providing valuable skills essential to heritage conservation. Additionally, it will also recognize the impact of such a large refugee population on the local Jordanian population, who share some of the same needs, and who will be trained alongside the refugees. Both groups will have the opportunity to attain valuable skills, develop relationships with professional colleagues, and reinforce their commitment to cultural heritage. Along with building capacity in masonry skills, which are essential to conservation programs and the larger construction trade, the program will present heritage sites as an inspiration and show connections between the history, architecture, and traditions of the region that can transcend contemporary national boundaries.

To launch this new initiative, World Monuments Fund and its British affiliate, World Monuments Fund Britain, will work with Petra National Trust in Jordan to create a training facility and recruit a catalyst group of qualified candidates who, once trained, can become mentors for subsequent trainees in the eighteen-month program. The project will be conducted in partnership with a British academic institution to be identified, and will include training in stone cutting; manufacture of molds, templates, and models; repair of damaged masonry; stabilization of arches, vaults and domes; underpinning and reinforcement of foundations; hoisting and lifting of stone block; methodologies for grouting and pinning masonry surfaces; lime technologies; surveying; stone selection and quarrying; cleaning historic stone; mortar analysis; and other related masonry conservation skills.
Dozens of Syrian refugees already living in the Unites States may have ties to terrorism and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is downplaying it, claiming federal agents missed “possible derogatory information” about the immigrants due to “a lapse in vetting.” Among those who slipped through the cracks is a man who failed a polygraph test after applying to work at a U.S. military installation and another who communicated with an Islamic State leader.

Information about this scandalous security lapse comes from federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the situation. They spoke to a mainstream newspaper on condition of anonymity, as many Judicial Watch sources who expose delicate information do, out of fear. This is the type of case the government works hard to keep quiet and consequences could be serious for those who blow the whistle. The news article reveals that federal agents are now “reinvestigating the backgrounds” of the dozens of Syrian refugees because somehow DHS discovered that the lapse in vetting allowed refugees with “potentially negative information in their files to enter the country.” The newspaper attributes the information to “U.S law enforcement officials” who were not authorized to discuss the matter.

Coincidentally, on the day this story broke a national newswire service reported that President Donald Trump drafted an executive order to stop accepting Syrian refugees. The president also plans to suspend issuing visas for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Under President Barrack Obama’s lax immigration policies, large numbers of terrorists from some of these nations entered the U.S., including members of ISIS and other radical Islamic groups. They include individuals who have engaged in or attempted to engage in acts of terrorism, conspired or attempted to conspire to provide material support to a terrorist organization or engaged in criminal conduct inspired by terrorist ideology. Some have been convicted and sentenced in American courts.

Additionally, the Obama administration was very generous in granting citizens of Muslim nations special amnesty protections and residency benefits in the U.S. During a five-year period, Obama’s DHS issued around 680,000 green cards to foreigners from Muslim countries, according to the agency’s figures. Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya were among the nations. In 2015 Judicial Watch reported on a special “humanitarian” amnesty program offered to illegal aliens from Yemen, an Islamic Middle Eastern country well known as an Al Qaeda breeding ground. Yemen is the headquarters of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the State Department has revealed that AQAP militants carried out hundreds of attacks including suicide bombers, vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), ambushes, kidnappings and targeted assassinations.

Circling back to Syrian refugees, as Obama let thousands settle in the U.S. his own intelligence and immigration officials admitted that individuals with ties to terrorist groups used the program to try to infiltrate the country and that there is no way to properly screen them. In 2015 the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) confirmed that individuals with ties to terrorist groups in Syria tried to gain entry to the U.S. through the refugee program and that the program is “vulnerable to exploitation from extremist groups seeking to send operatives to the West.” Before that the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Matthew Emrich, admitted during a congressional hearing that there’s no way to adequately screen Syrian refugees because the Syrian government doesn’t have an intelligence database to run checks against. Additionally, FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach conceded that the U.S. government has no system to properly screen Syrian refugees.

Time and again we learn that liberals lie to us.

Under the Obama administration, they wanted states to take in thousands of refugees from foreign countries.

They pretended this was good for our country. We are a nation of immigrants, right? So Americans could not be upset about thousands, tens of thousands, of strangers being dumped into our communities.

They did not want to tell us these were people from Muslim-majority countries, who do not value or embrace American customs. They do not believe in free speech, freedom of religion, or even equal rights for women.

Nor did the liberals tell us these thousands of refugees would be a burden to the taxpayer–the real reason democrats want them. All these new faces would drain our government benefits. That would require the federal government to spend more, pass more regulation, and gobble up more power.

But one state found a special way to send refugees packing. And it only highlighted how little these foreigners respect our country and way of life.

From Mad World News:

According to the Phoenix New Times, at least half of the 7,351 Somali refugees resettled in Arizona have moved out of the state because there are not enough welfare and government benefits for their liking. Additionally, they are fleeing because the state requires them to learn English and find jobs in order to attain food stamps.

Like all refugees, each migrant resettled in Arizona receive a lump payment of $925 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Of course, the state receiving said migrants is expected to foot the rest of their bills after the stipend is used up. However, Arizona doesn’t offer additional funding unless these welfarers take the necessary steps to earn them, which tellingly proves to be too much for many.

Amazing, isn’t it? These people had the red carpet rolled out for them, thanks to Obama and the liberals. They were given free money, housing, and benefits from our government. They weren’t required to do anything but learn English and find work.

Yikes! That was far too much for these ingrates. English is the official language of the United States. It’s ludicrous for anyone to live here without knowing it on a basic level. And why should refugees come here and not try to find work?

Generations of immigrants came to American, for the sole purpose of finding work. They busted their humps to earn a living and prove they deserved to be here. Yet today, entitled immigrants, refugees, and illegals come here expecting handouts. While American citizens pay the bill.

No more folks. The liberal era is over. If people from other countries want to come to America, they better learn of our ways and get to working. Learning English and getting a job are hardly strict demands; it’s what every other person in America is expected to do.

If a refugee can’t even do that, then what are they doing here?
