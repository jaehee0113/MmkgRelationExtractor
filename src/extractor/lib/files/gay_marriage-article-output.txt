Chairman Crowley Statement on Resolution Condemning Persecution of Gay Men in Chechnya

(Washington, DC) – House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-NY) issued the following statement after the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the persecution of gay men in Chechnya, a semi-autonomous Russian republic:

“The murder and persecution of gay men in Chechnya is a human rights abuse that world leaders must strongly condemn. Today’s resolution underscores how strongly U.S. leaders stand united in their demand that Chechnya officials put an immediate end to the targeting and slaughter of gay men and ensure that perpetrators of this human rights atrocity are thoroughly investigated and punished.”

At Miss Hispanidad Gay 2016, competitors vie for the crown and to represent North Carolina’s Hispanic community. The pageant is particularly relevant today: it’s a latino, LGBT event in a state that has recently passed laws that repeal the civil rights of trans people. “It’s not acceptable in society to kiss or hold hands with our partner,” says Oskar Menen, who goes by the stage name of Gaga L’Draga. “I think the public out there is missing some tolerance for our community.” The Atlantic travelled to Durham, North Carolina, to film the event and get the perspectives of competitors and organizers.

The Bottom Line

Unjust: LGBTQ Youth Incarcerated in the Juvenile Justice System examines how LGBTQ youth who are incarcerated in juvenile detention and correctional facilities face bias in adjudication, and mistreatment and abuse in confinement facilities. LGBTQ youth also lack supportive services when leaving the criminal and juvenile justice systems, often forcing them back into negative interactions with law enforcement.

Given that nearly 40% of incarcerated girls in identify as LGB and 85-90% of incarcerated LGBTQ youth are youth of color, it is crucial that any effort to change the way youth in the United States engage with the juvenile justice system must consider the unique experiences of LGBTQ youth. This spotlight report highlights the experiences of LGBTQ youth incarcerated in the juvenile justice system.

This report builds off of the Unjust series released in 2016. Click here to see the other reports in the series.
