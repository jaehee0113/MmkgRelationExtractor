EU investment plan want to mobilise €44 billion in private sector investment in Africa July 10, 2017
Published on Jun 14, 2017

Regenerative agriculture offers a future for sustainable farming of meat in line with nature’s needs, by using holistic management and organic/biodynamic practices and even sequestering carbon in the soil – so important in the fight against climate change. At Mangarara, in New Zealand’s beautiful Hawke’s Bay, Greg Hart and his family are in the process of restoring 1500 acres of land conventionally farmed for over 150 years into the paradise it once was.

Smallholder Farmers in Kenya in the Race Against Climate Change

By adopting agroforestry and improved agricultural practices, a community in western Kenya has increased their income and improved their living standards. They are now training other farmers to do the same, writes Susan Onyango for the World Agroforestry Centre.

Mangroves are a massive storehouse of carbon. The mangroves of Indonesia, with its vast expanse of islands and coastlines, cover an area of around 3 million hectares. These tangled trees and the swampy soil they grow in store approximately 3.14 billion tons of carbon, hence they play an important role in climate change mitigation. Indonesia is home to about 1/3rd of the global storage of mangroves, CIFOR scientist Daniel Murdiyarso says. In North Sumatra, scientists measured the amount of carbon in both protected and degraded mangrove forests lining the province.

Climate change is driving poverty and migration among the poorest populations in developing countries, say leaders of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Organization for Migration. "We need to systematically integrate migration and climate change into national development and poverty reduction programs, disaster risk reduction and crisis planning and develop agricultural policies and practices that enhance resilience in the face of climate-induced forced migration," says IOM Director-General William Lacy Swing.
When thinking about this question, many will answer by saying that technologies like...

Musim panas di seluruh dunia kini terasa lebih panas dibandingkan tahun-tahun sebelumnya, dan akan semakin parah pada akhir abad ini jika polusi karbon terus meningkat. Kondisi ini akan paling terasa di kawasan perkotaan.

Saat ini, sekitar 54 persen populasi dunia hidup daerah urban, dan penduduk perkotaan diperkirakan tumbuh sebesar 2,5 miliar orang pada tahun 2050. Kombinasi pertumbuhan penduduk yang pesat dan pemanasan global dapat meningkatkan suhu daerah perkotaan hingga mencapai titik yang membahayakan kesehatan dan perekonomian penduduknya.

Menelisik Lebih dalam Tentang Pemanasan Global

Penyebab-penyebab Pemanasan Global



Untuk menggambarkan seberapa panas kota-kota dunia di masa depan dan pilihan yang mereka hadapi, Climate Central membuat model interaktif berikut ini.

Jika Anda mengetikkan nama kota atau mengklik titik lokasi, maka akan muncul nama kota dan suhunya pada musim panas saat ini. Garis yang muncul kemudian akan mengarahkan Anda ke kota kedua yang suhu musim panasnya saat ini akan menjadi suhu musim panas kota pertama pada tahun 2100. Dengan asumsi, selama rentang waktu tersebut, tak ada upaya signifikan untuk mengendalikan emisi karbon.

Dampak-dampak Pemanasan Global Kini Semakin Nyata

Es Laut Antarktika Menyusut Hingga Titik Terendah

Kita juga bisa mengetahui seberapa besar perbedaan yang dihasilkan jika kita melakukan upaya pengurangan emisi moderat. Kata “moderat” digunakan untuk menggambarkan pengurangan emisi sekitar setengahnya antara sekarang dan tahun 2100. Jumlah pengurangan emisi ini kira-kira sesuai dengan apa yang dibutuhkan untuk mencapai tujuan Perjanjian Paris dalam KTT Perubahan Iklim pada tahun 2015 yang membatasi pemanasan global rata-rata sampai 2 derajat Celsius.

Berdasarkan model tersebut, dalam skenario polusi tinggi, Kota Ottawa di Kanada yang saat ini relatif sejuk, pada tahun 2100 mendatang bisa memiliki iklim tropis seperti di Kota Belize, Belize, saat ini. Kota Kabul di Afghanistan yang dikelilingi pegunungan, bisa terasa seperti Kolombo, kota pesisir di Sri Lanka. Kota Kairo di Mesir yang sudah terkenal panas, akan terasa benar-benar terik seperti Abu Dhabi, kota di negara tetangga.

Suhu daratan rata-rata diproyeksikan meningkat 4,8 derajat Celsius, tetapi karena keanehan geografi, beberapa kota akan lebih panas dari lainnya. Kota Sofia di Bulgaria diprediksi mengalami perubahan suhu terbesar secara keseluruhan, dengan kenaikan suhu hampir 8,4 derajat Celsius pada 2100. Kenaikan ini akan membuat musim panas di Sofia terasa seperti musim panas di Port Said, Mesir, saat ini.

10 kota di dunia yang diprediksi akan mengalami perubahan suhu terbesar pada tahun 2100. (Climate Central)

Bagaimana dengan Indonesia?

Dalam model interaktif yang disuguhkan oleh Climate Central, ada empat kota besar di Indonesia yang ditampilkan: Medan, Jakarta, Bandung dan Surabaya.

Suhu Kota Medan di musim panas saat ini adalah 31,8° C. Tanpa pengurangan emisi moderat, suhu Kota Medan pada tahun 2100 akan mengalami kenaikan menjadi 35,2° C. Angka tersebut setara dengan suhu New Delhi, India, pada musim panas saat ini. Tetapi jika dengan pengurangan emisi moderat, suhu Kota Medan menjadi seperti Bangkok, Thailand, yaitu 33,1° C.

Jakarta dan Bandung yang saat ini suhunya 29,9° C, tanpa pengurangan emisi moderat, pada 2100 suhunya akan setara dengan suhu Phnom Penh, Kamboja saat ini (32,5° C). Dengan pengurangan emisi moderat, pada 2100 suhu kedua kota tersebut akan sama dengan suhu Singapura saat ini, yaitu 31,5° C.

Jakarta yang saat ini suhunya 29,9° C, tanpa pengurangan emisi moderat, pada 2100 suhunya akan setara dengan suhu Phnom Penh, Kamboja saat ini (32,5° C). (Climate Central)

Sedangkan suhu Kota Surabaya yang saat ini sekitar 28,6° C, jika tanpa pengurangan emisi moderat, akan meningkat 3,4 derajat menjadi 32° C pada 2100, setara dengan Kota Kuching, Malaysia pada saat ini. Namun dengan pengurangan emisi moderat, suhu Kota Surabaya pada tahun 2100 mendatang akan sama dengan suhu Bandung saat ini (29,9° C).

Kenaikan suhu di kota-kota Indonesia belum seberapa. Beberapa kota lain di dunia akan mengalami suhu yang tak ada bandingannya di Bumi. Kota Khartoum di Sudan, misalnya, bila tak ada upaya pengendalian emisi, suhu musim panasnya diproyeksikan akan meroket dari 39,6° C menjadi 44,1° C. Saat ini, tak ada tempat di Bumi yang suhunya sepanas itu. Perubahan tersebut menggarisbawahi bahwa kecuali polusi karbon terkendali, planet ini dapat menuju keadaan yang tak pernah dialami umat manusia sebelumnya.

Scattered thunderstorms will be rumbling across the mountains and eastern plains through mid-evening. A few storms could turn briefly severe with hail up to an inch in diameter and 60 mph wind gusts, but a large outbreak of severe weather is not likely.

Skies will return to partly cloudy overnight as the thunderstorms diminish. Temperatures will cool to the upper 50s to low 60s for lower elevations and upper 40s to low 50s in the mountains by sunrise.

Tuesday will be another... warm one, with highs in the low to mid 90s on the plains and upper 70s to low 80s in the mountains. The morning hours will be dry, but clouds will be building over the mountains with some showers and thunderstorms developing by midday. The thunderstorms will drift onto the I-25 Corridor and across the plains later in the afternoon.

Soil carbon – the “carbon beneath our feet” – could help mitigate significant greenhouse gas emissions, while also supporting food production and adaptation to climate change. As such, soil carbon could be crucial to meeting the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to below 2 degrees and Sustainable Development Goals related to food security and climate. However, we still lack the knowledge needed to sustainably manage soil for carbon.
